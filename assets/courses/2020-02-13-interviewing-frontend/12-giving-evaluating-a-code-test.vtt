1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.599
如果你要做一个密码测试，你可能已经有很多了。
If you're giving a code test,
which probably a lot of you have already.

2
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:06.429
如果你没有你可能在你职业生涯的某个时候
If you haven't, you probably will
at some point in your career,

3
00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:07.879
你会给我一个密码测试
you're gonna give a code test.

4
00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.009
这些都是你想做的事情。
These are things you want to do.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.869
尽可能直接地使问题变得简单。
Make the problem straightforward,
as much as possible.

6
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.969
应该是这里的要求， bam， bam， bam。
It should be here are the requirements,
bam, bam, bam.

7
00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.190
是否符合这些要求?
Do they fulfill these requirements?.

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.280
如果你花了 20 分钟来解释这个问题，那不是一个好问题。
If it takes you 20 minutes to explain
the problem, it's not a good problem.

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.449
[ LAUGH] 请花两分钟来解释您正在尝试执行的操作或
[LAUGH] It should take two minutes to
explain what you're trying to do or

10
00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.539
它应该很明显
it should be readily apparent.

11
00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.850
给我读一下提示
Have a read me with tips in there.

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.490
如果你想用风格指引也行
If you wanna put in style guidelines,
that's fine too.

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.850
但让问题直接变得简单，不要使问题复杂化。
But just make the problem straightforward
and don't over complicate it.

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.279
我曾经采访过我的宝石
I once, so my gem stories,
I once interviewed for

15
00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:45.920
或申请成为公司前工程师的角色。
or applied for our a role as
a front engineer for a company.

16
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.679
他们给了我一个密码测试，就是这个点像像素点的图像，所以点像素点，
And they gave me a code test, it was,
given this dot pixel image, so dot pixels,

17
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.380
很多人都不知道那是什么，但它是一个由很小的点组成的图像。
a lot of you won't know what that is, but
it's an image made up of tiny little dots.

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.020
他们不是在一起，别在推特上 @ 我。
They're not so together,
don't @ me on Twitter.

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060
我知道所有的图像都是由很小的点组成的
I know all images are made
up of tiny little dots.

20
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.920
但这个是由更大的点组成的。
But this is made of larger dots.

21
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.960
这个想法是，你必须分析这个图像，我对此一无所知。
And the idea was, you had to parse this
image, which I know nothing about.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.725
你得解析这个形象然后创造康韦的人生游戏
You had to parse this image and
then create Conway's game of life so

23
00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:15.698
在 1000 次迭代中，它创建了此图像。
that in 1000 iterations
it created this image.

24
00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:18.849
真正的面试问题
Real interview question.

25
00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.460
这些是我当时没有的技能。
These are skills that I
did not have at the time.

26
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.924
我不知道如何解析一个影像从不读康韦的游戏
I didn't know how to parse an image, never
read an implementation of Conway's game of

27
00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.780
生命，更不用说让它倒退了。
life, let alone getting
it to run backwards.

28
00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.510
这不一定是个好的代码测试。
That's not necessarily a good code test.

29
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.379
也许是为了那个公司
Maybe it was for that company.

30
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.200
不是给我的
It wasn't for me.

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.270
我都没做过
I just didn't even do it.

32
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.439
没什么不对的
Nothing wrong with that.

33
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.689
如果你有这样的挑战，你会觉得这不是件好事。
And if you get a challenge that
you're like this isn't good.

34
00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.189
我不同意
I don't agree with this.

35
00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.430
你不必这么做的
You don't have to do it.

36
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.979
你不必在这方面自杀
You don't have to kill yourself on it.

37
00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.030
应对所有挑战都是好的。
It's good to take on all challenges.

38
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.729
但如果你觉得这是侮辱
But if you feel like this is insulting or

39
00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.650
这和我的技能不相关你不用这么做
this isn't relevant to my skill set,
you don't have to do it.

40
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.599
没事的没事的
It's okay.

41
00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.890
然后给他们反馈
And give them that feedback.

42
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.246
如果你可以说，我不觉得我的技能有关系，
If you can say like, I don't feel
it's relevant in my skill set,

43
00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:59.270
很有礼貌但没问题
be polite about it, but that's fine.

44
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.733
但如果你给密码测试我真正想要的人做什么
But if you're giving the code test
what I really want people to do and

45
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:07.379
这是我们根本不做的事情，要诚实面对时间的限制。
this is something we don't do at all,
be honest with the time constraints.

46
00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.960
这是密码测试需要五到七个小时
Here's a code test,
it's gonna take five to seven hours.

47
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.270
我通常会把他们告诉我的东西翻倍
I usually double whatever
they tell me it's gonna take.

48
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.219
如果他们说要花十个小时大概需要 20 个小时
If they say it's gonna take ten hours,
it'll probably take 20 hours.

49
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.479
想想感同身受
And think about empathy.

50
00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.090
你想在桌子的另一边找工作吗
Would you wanna be on the other side
of the table, you're looking for a job,

51
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.659
有人像我一样
and someone's like hey,

52
00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.090
这是一个密码挑战需要八个小时才能完成
here's a code challenge that's
gonna take eight hours to complete.

53
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.610
那是你在做的八小时无酬劳动
That's eight hours of unpaid
labor that you're doing, and

54
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.469
要花八个小时以上的时间
it's gonna take them
more than eight hours.

55
00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.879
所以尽量把它保持在两到三个小时的范围内
So try to keep it down to
the two to three hour range,

56
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.620
你能在这件事上做点什么
something you can complete in that.

57
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.810
如果可能的话，给他们选择。
And if possible, give them the option.

58
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.379
这是我最喜欢的东西之一
This is one of my favorite things.

59
00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.659
给他们选择
Give them the option.

60
00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.719
给他们说我们有个密码测试要两三个四个小时
Give them say hey we have a code test
gonna take two, three, four hours.

61
00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.250
或者我们有个电话屏幕要一个小时
Or we have a phone screen,
it's gonna take an hour.

62
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.740
因为不同的人有不同的长处。
Because different people
have different strengths.

63
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.000
有些人，生活代码想把它弄明白，他们很棒。
Some people, live code wanna get it done,
they're great at that.

64
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.500
有些人，他们会感到焦虑，他们会感到紧张。
Some people, they get anxiety,
they get nervous.

65
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.932
所以在这件案子里给他们一个密码测试
So in that case give them a code test,

66
00:02:58.932 --> 00:03:01.680
给他们一些能坐下来研究的东西想办法
give them something they can sit
down research, figure out how to do.

67
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.939
所以，如果可能的话，给人们一个选择。
So if possible, give people an option.

68
00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.580
我想我们都应该这样做
I think we should all be doing that

69
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.990
因为有时我很着急
as engineers because
sometimes I'm in a hurry.

70
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.389
我想让我们把这事弄明白
I'm like, let's just get this done.

71
00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.909
把电话给我
Give me the phone screen.

72
00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.560
有时我有时间这对我来说很重要
Sometimes I got time and
this is really important to me.

73
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.770
我要给你看看我能做什么
I'm going to show you what I can do.

74
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.830
我去做密码测试
I'll do the code tests.

75
00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.590
重要的是，有代码复审核对表。
Importantly, have a code review checklist.

76
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.450
应该沿着这条线看
It should look something
along these lines.

77
00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:26.319
所以，你可以向所有人申请一个 rubric 。
So as in have a rubric that
you can apply to everybody.

78
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.939
所以在这样做的过程中，你消除了任何偏见，比如，嘿，这个人叫杰姆
So in doing this, you remove any bias you
have, like, hey, this person's named Jem

79
00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.389
所以我打赌他们会在这个密码测试中做得很好
too, so I bet they're gonna do
pretty well at this code test.

80
00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.319
我已经有偏见了
I already have bias there.

81
00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.500
有一个 rubric ，你可以给所有正在审查的工程师
Having a rubric that you can give
to all engineers who are reviewing

82
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.930
这个代码测试意味着它不止一个可以复审测试的人员。
this code test means it's more than
one person that can review the tests.

83
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.099
这不仅仅是一个工程师，你可以公平地向每个人申请。
It's not just one engineer and
you can apply it fairly to everybody.

84
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.263
他们是例外我们想马上把他们带到现场
They're exceptional, we wanna bring them
on site immediately and if they pass,

85
00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:56.000
我们会给他们很高的工资他们做得很好
we're gonna give them very high salaries,
they did really well.

86
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.620
那是什么让他们特别的
Well what makes them exceptional?

87
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.770
你认为自己是一个杰出的工程师是什么呢 ?
What are things you consider
to be an exceptional engineer?

88
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.060
如果他们是普通的那也很好
Well if they're average, that's fine too.

89
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.659
你是在找普通工程师吗
Are you looking for average engineers?

90
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.000
是啊也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

91
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.319
或者你就像我只想要顶级的，例外的或是破产的
Or maybe you're like I only want top tier,
exceptional or bust.

92
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.979
那是你的
That's on you.

93
00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.302
我不想告诉你具体怎么聘用
I'm not gonna tell you how
to hire specifically, but

94
00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:17.160
我可以告诉你面试的方式
I can tell you how to the interview.

95
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.939
但是做这些事情是大公司的事了
But doing stuff like this is again
things that larger companies have down,

96
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.399
每个公司都有这样做的地方
they've got every company for
something like this where they should.

97
00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:30.019
开始吧是个小混混
Start ups, it's a little mixed bag.

98
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:35.293
这就是我之前得到的一点因为如果我说的是 ES2019
And this is a point that has gotten me
before because if I use a say ES2019 or

99
00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:40.002
在我的剧本里我和那个人都不明白
a ES2020 in my scripts and
the person doesn't understand that,

100
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:44.560
这可能不是什么 JavaScripts ，失败。
there might be like,
this isn't JavaScripts, fail.

101
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.620
但如果你有这种粗鲁的感觉我真的不明白
But if you have this rubric of like,
hey, I don't really get this, but

102
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.819
他们使用先进的功能
they use advanced features.

103
00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.199
这也太酷了把它放好
That's cool too, put that under good.

104
00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:56.500
是啊但你只想要一个公平的竞争环境
Yeah, but you just want a level
playing field, you wanna make it

105
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.689
当你给某人一个密码测试时是可以预测的
as predictable as possible when
you give someone a code test.

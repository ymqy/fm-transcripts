00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.289
在采访过程中的某个时候，
At the some point in
the interview process,

2
00:00:02.289 --> 00:00:05.123
你得做个电话屏幕或者密码测试
you're going to have to do probably
a phone screen or a code test.

3
00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:10.118
我之前采访过的很多公司都在做手机屏幕，因为它是
A lot of companies that I've interviewed
before do phone screens because it's

4
00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:13.856
有一个很好的机会让一个工程师去找另一个工程师
a good chance to have an engineer
talk to another engineer.

5
00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:17.475
通常都是通过视频，或者可能只是通过电话。
So usually it's over video or
it might just be over telephone.

6
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:22.077
但是，实际上，这是一种机会，可以在双方都能接触到第一次接触。
But, really, it's a chance to kind of
meet your first reach out on both sides.

7
00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:24.687
你要和你一起工作的人见面
You meet the kind of person
you're gonna be working with.

8
00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:31.114
你会遇到的，你也会理解他们会问什么样的问题。
You meet and you kind of understand
what sort of questions do they ask.

9
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.720
他们怎么说问题
How do they word questions?

10
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.963
他们有多友好
How friendly are they?

11
00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:36.430
他们在很多问题上都在开玩笑，就像放松一样吗 ?
Do they joke around a lot,
and like kind of relax?

12
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.511
他们是非常，非常僵硬，而且因书的不同而不同。
Are they very, very stiff and
vary by the book.

13
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:42.935
这些事情都要靠自己来做
And all these things will depend and
it's a good chance for

14
00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.061
你作为候选人去感受公司的感觉
you as the candidates to get a feel for
the company,

15
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.003
作为采访者找到候选人的感觉是一个很好的机会。
it's a good chance as the interviewer
to get a feel for the candidate.

16
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:52.341
他们密码的时候他们就放心了吗
Are they at ease when they code?

17
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:52.880
他们放松了吗
Are they relaxed?

18
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.200
但希望你能把手机屏幕的选项给他们密码测试
But hopefully, you'll give them the option
of the phone screen to code test.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.284
很多时候，我更喜欢电话屏幕，我们就能得到它。
A lot of times, I prefer the phone screen,
we get right to it.

20
00:01:01.284 --> 00:01:03.767
我不会再花时间做密码测试了
I don't spend any extra of
my time doing code test.

21
00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:08.799
通常，电话屏幕显示 30 分钟到一个小时，在那里的某个地方。
Phone screens generally, say 30 minutes
to an hour, somewhere in there.

22
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.204
他们做的是实时编码。
And they're done live coding.

23
00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.018
所以有些人有些紧张
So, some people that get a little nervous,

24
00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:17.067
实践这些我们要做的事情很不错
it's good to practice these things
which we're gonna do in a little bit.

25
00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:21.539
但是真正的让神经脱离生命的代码对我们来说是很有帮助的
But really kind of get the nerves out life
code it's really helpful to kind of see

26
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.433
在我给手机屏幕的时候，有人通过一个问题来工作。
how someone works through a problem
when I'm giving a phone screen.

27
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:31.918
作为手机屏幕的候选人，当你在中间的时候会问问题。
As the candidate for phone screen, when
you're in the middle of it ask questions.

28
00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:35.216
我真的希望有人问我这样的问题，我能做到吗 ?
I really want someone to ask me
questions like hey, can I do this?

29
00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:36.151
要我这么做吗
Should I do this?

30
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:37.670
这是正确的做法吗 ?
Is this the right way?

31
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.479
现在的问题并不太多我只是在为你解决这个问题
Not too many questions for it's like well
now I'm just solving the problem for you.

32
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.728
但我希望有人问我真实生活的问题
But I want someone to ask me questions
cuz that's how it is in real life.

33
00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:49.450
没有人分配您的项目，就像祝你在一个月内好运。
No one assigns your projects and
like good luck see you in a month.

34
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.659
不你有对话我想让你和我一起
No, you have the dialogue and
that's what I want it with the coterie and

35
00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.567
你应该试着跟采访者建立联系
that's what you should try to
establish with the interviewer.

36
00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:56.890
他们是否有所帮助?
Are they helpful?

37
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.906
或者他们被开除了
Or are they dismissive.

38
00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.149
他们是友好和外向的，你就像，我知道，电话屏幕很烂，
Are they friendly and outgoing, you're
like, I understand, phone screens suck,

39
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.878
面试很烂
interviews suck.

40
00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:07.231
他们很友好，或者总是这样，这是浪费我的时间，
And they're friendly, or there always
like, this is a waste of my time,

41
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.282
真不敢相信我这么做
I can't believe I'm doing this.

42
00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:12.775
这个人为什么不明白我在说什么
Why, doesn't this person
understand what I'm talking about?

43
00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:16.056
这些都是你在电话屏幕里要审查的东西，所以问问题。
These are things you should vet out during
the phone screen, so ask questions.

44
00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:19.715
解决你的问题，特别是如果你被困住了。
Talk out your solution,
especially if you get stuck.

45
00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:20.960
它对任何人都没有帮助。
It does not help anybody.

46
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.787
如果你坐在你的脑袋里
If you're sitting there
thinking inside your head.

47
00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:25.409
你要在采访中大声说出来
You have to talk out
loud in any interview.

48
00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.490
这就是你想在这里建立我的方式
That's what you have to do you
want to establish here's how I'm

49
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.816
思考一个问题。
thinking about a problem.

50
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:34.360
你也许是绝对正确的面试说的不错的想法
And you might be absolutely right
the interview say yeah, good thinking.

51
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.711
是啊不我觉得你是在正确的道路上
Yeah, no,
I think you're on the right path here or

52
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:38.698
他们可能就像你离开的时候一样
they might be like you're way off course.

53
00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:40.548
你在思考这个问题的方式是完全错误的。
And the way you're thinking about
the problem is completely wrong.

54
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.418
这是一种更好的思考方式。
And here's a better way to think about it.

55
00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:46.091
但不管怎么说除非你大声说话
But either way, you can't get
there unless you talk out loud and

56
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.098
说说你是怎么想这个问题的
talk about how you're
thinking about the problem.

57
00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:51.319
并且在环境中感到舒适。
And get comfortable in the environment.

58
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.610
如果使用代码笔或代码测试，其中有很多。
If using code pen or code tests,
there's a lot of them.

59
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.284
提前问吧
Ask ahead of time,

60
00:02:57.284 --> 00:03:00.081
他们会向你传达一个你要使用的环境的链接
they'll generally send you a link to
the environment you're gonna be using.

61
00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:01.824
他们会说这是一个 CodePen 链接，或者类似的东西。
They'll say it's a CodePen link,
or something like that.

62
00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:04.603
请放心，了解该处的调试方案。
Get comfortable,
understand the debugging scenario there.

63
00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:06.360
某些环境，您可以调试。
Some environments, you can debug.

64
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.467
一些环境，对调试很有挑战性。
Some environments,
it's challenging to debug.

65
00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.074
但你知道吗你要把密码活活吗
But understand that,
are you gonna be running the code live?

66
00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:13.932
它会输出什么东西，还是只是，他们想知道你是怎么编码的吗 ?
Is it gonna output something, or
is it just, they wanna see how you code?

67
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:18.228
这不一定是可以执行的。
That's not necessarily
gonna be executable.

68
00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:22.975
作为手机屏幕的采访者，你在一个安静的地方吗 ?
As the interviewer for the phone screen,
are you in a quiet area?

69
00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:26.961
在一个安静的地方是很尊敬的，他们花了一个小时的时间
Being in a quiet area is just respectful,
they took an hour of the day as busy

70
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.201
做这个手机屏幕的人至少能给他们安静点的东西
people to do this phone screen the least
you can do is give them something quiet,

71
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:33.637
没有人在后台找到乒乓球
not people find ping
pong in the background.

72
00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:37.526
有一次我接到一个可怕的电话，这不是电话屏幕，
I once had a terrible call and
this wasn't the phone screen,

73
00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:41.349
这是招聘者，但是我就像，我几乎听不见你。
this was recruiter, but
I was like, I can barely hear you.

74
00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.218
就像，我的名字叫什么，什么，什么，什么，什么，什么，什么，什么，什么，
It's like, my name's blah, blah,
blah I'm with blah, blah, blah company.

75
00:03:45.218 --> 00:03:47.176
我听不见你的声音
I'm like, I can't hear you.

76
00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:48.112
抱歉我们工作得太辛苦了
Sorry we're in a WeWork.

77
00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:51.938
我喜欢很酷我们和玻璃墙一起工作
I'm like, cool,
we work with the glass walls.

78
00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.847
但那不是我的问题
But that's not my problem.

79
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:57.563
你的工作就是跟我谈话至少你能做的就是
Your job is to have this conversation
with me, the least you could do is

80
00:03:57.563 --> 00:04:00.532
在一个安静的地方我能听到你说话
be respectful and
be in a quiet area where I can hear you.

81
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.010
这不太不合理 [ LAUGH]。
That's not too unreasonable [LAUGH].

82
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.819
而在他们的电话屏幕上唯一的问题是，问题的措辞是否正确 ?
And the only thing to ask on their phone
screen is, is the problem well worded?

83
00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.608
他们要花 15 分钟还是要花 15 分钟
Are they gonna spend 15 minutes or are you
gonna spend 15 minutes of that an hour or

84
00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:14.453
有 45 分钟向他们解释问题吗
45 minute time explaining
the problem to them?

85
00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:16.891
如果是这样，这可能不是一个好问题。
If so, that's probably not a good problem.

86
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:19.603
他们要做的事情应该是很清楚的，很简练的，
They should be very clear and
very concise about what they need to do,

87
00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:21.865
他们需要执行的事情你要找的是什么
what they need to execute on,
what you're looking for.

88
00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:25.509
最理想的是两分钟最多
Ideally, two three minutes at most.

89
00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.302
这应该是一个很直接的问题。
It should be a very
straightforward problem.

90
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.307
候选人是否知道需求和限制是什么 ?
Does the candidate know what
the requirements and restrictions are?

91
00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:35.370
你有没有说过，你不能用 jQuery ，你不能用 React，
Did you say hey, you can't use jQuery,
you can't use React,

92
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.365
你不能用任何图书馆
you can't use any libraries.

93
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.534
这只是单纯的香草 JavaScript
It's just pure vanilla JavaScript.

94
00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:42.242
或者，你可以进口任何你想要的东西，不管做什么。
Or hey, you can import whatever you want,
whatever gets the job done.

95
00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:43.942
但候选人是否知道呢 ?
But does the candidate know that?

96
00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:46.475
确保他们知道你什么时候接受采访
Make sure they know when you're
giving that interview or

97
00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:49.449
你给了一个手机屏幕你到底在找什么
you're given a phone screen,
what exactly you're looking for.

98
00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.465
你最后还是请假了 ?
And did you leave time for
question at the end?

99
00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:56.500
你应该总是在最后的时候留到问题的时候
You should always leave time for
question at the end, always.

100
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.800
同样地，你甚至没有试图建立。
Again, you're not even
trying to establish.

101
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.314
他们能解决这个问题吗 ?
Can they solve this problem?

102
00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:02.742
我们想知道他们是怎么想的
We're trying to understand
how do they think?

103
00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:04.473
他们是否有能力搬去外面的世界 ?
Are they capable of moving
on to the outside world?

104
00:05:04.473 --> 00:05:06.747
我们会建立，他们能解决这些问题吗 ?
We'll establish,
can they solve these problems?

105
00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:09.379
我们真正想的是他们如何看待一个问题
What we're really trying to get to
how they think about a problem,

106
00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.153
他们怎么处理这个问题，他们会问很多这样的问题吗 ?
how they approach it, do they ask
a lot of questions things like that.

107
00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:15.163
但正是这些对话，所以对话就需要以另一种方式进行。
But it's these dialogue, so the dialogue
needs to go back the other way.

108
00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:17.067
结束提问的时间。
Leaves time for questions at the end.

109
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:21.497
如果你想不重要我们还有 45 分钟
Make sure it doesn't matter if you're
like, we got 45 minutes and so

110
00:05:21.497 --> 00:05:22.615
我们没时间了
we ran out of time.

111
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:24.168
这也是关于尊重的问题。
Again, it's about respect.

112
00:05:24.168 --> 00:05:25.411
是关于同理心的。
It's about empathy.

113
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:27.613
如果我跟一个想知道的人说话
If I'm talking to someone I want to know,
well,

114
00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:29.350
你在公司工作多久了
how long have you been at the company?

115
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.268
我想知道证交会是什么
I want to know what the SEC is.

116
00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:33.163
你是哪个队的
What team are you on?

117
00:05:33.163 --> 00:05:34.689
你都是 UI 工程师吗
Are you even the UI engineer,

118
00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.903
它们可能不是您可能获得一般一般工程问题的时候。
oftentimes they may not be you might get
a generic general engineering question.

119
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:40.428
你可能有个前端的问题
You might get a front end question.

120
00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:43.312
可能是他们第一次使用手机屏幕。
It might be someone that it's their
first time giving a phone screen.

121
00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:46.673
这些都是，但你想再给点问题时间，因为再一次，
All these things, but you wanna give time
for questions at the end because again,

122
00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:48.584
是关于两个人之间的对话
it's about the dialogue
between two people.

123
00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:51.817
嗯。
Yes.

124
00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:56.473
>> 作为候选人询问采访者的良好做法是否良好
&gt;&gt; Is it good practice as a candidate
to ask the interviewer what type of

125
00:05:56.473 --> 00:05:58.689
他们会问吗
questions they're gonna ask?

126
00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:59.199
>> 是。
&gt;&gt; Yes.

127
00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.682
我们会在现场讨论这个问题。
And we'll talk about that for the on-site.

128
00:06:00.682 --> 00:06:04.569
电话屏幕他们可能不会告诉你或者他们会告诉你
The phone screen, they may not tell you or
they might tell you.

129
00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.728
我知道这对我毫无帮助
I know it's not helpful at all.

130
00:06:06.728 --> 00:06:10.130
有些公司会说，嘿，这是一个正面的焦点问题，
Some companies will say, hey,
it's a frontend focus question so

131
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.148
你会做点什么的
you're gonna be building something.

132
00:06:12.148 --> 00:06:15.268
或者他们会说这是普通的 CS 问题
Or they might say,
it's a general CS problem,

133
00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:18.935
一种泄漏的代码样式一般 CS 问题解决方法。
kind of a leaked code style

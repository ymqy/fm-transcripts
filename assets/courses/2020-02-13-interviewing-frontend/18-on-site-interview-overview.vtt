1
00:00:02.403 --> 00:00:04.876
现在我们要去现场
Now we're to the on-site portion,

2
00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:08.723
我们都认为采访都是谎言
the part where we all think
all of the interviewing lies.

3
00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:11.519
很多人都这样做了，这才是最后一步。
And a lot of it does,
cuz this is the final step.

4
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.749
通常是现场，然后你要么通过要么失败。
Usually it's the on-site, and
then you either pass or you fail.

5
00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.172
你有个提议要么你不做
You get an offer or you don't.

6
00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:18.832
这就是每个人都焦虑的地方。
And this is the part where
everybody has anxiety.

7
00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:21.317
所以我们要掩盖很多关于 JavaScript 的问题。
So we're gonna cover a lot
of JavaScript questions.

8
00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:25.730
我们将覆盖 JavaScript 的基础和相关的东西。
We're gonna cover JavaScript fundamentals,
things that are relevant.

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.989
但我们也要做面谈者我在找什么
But we're also gonna cover as
the interviewer, what am I looking for

10
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.609
当我问这个问题的时候
when I ask this question?

11
00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.143
它告诉我他们的工程背景是什么 ?
What does it tell me about
their engineering background?

12
00:00:34.143 --> 00:00:35.792
它能告诉我他们的技能吗
What does it tell me
about their skill set?

13
00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.109
他们怎么想的呢
What does it tell about how they think?

14
00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.520
作为候选人，你试图给出最好的表现。
And as the candidate,
you're trying to give the best showing.

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.619
我的朋友布莱恩 - 霍尔特曾经说过，当你到公司的时候
Cuz as my friend Brian Holt once said,
when you get this far into the company,

16
00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:46.829
他们想雇你
they wanna hire you.

17
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.753
他们显然需要一个有才华的工程师。
They obviously need a talented engineer.

18
00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:52.604
所以他们只是在找一个不雇用你的理由
So they're really just looking for
a reason not to hire you and

19
00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:54.463
别给他们理由
don't give them the reason.

20
00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:58.759
记住，大声想，解决问题，把它写出来。
Remember, think out loud,
solve the problems, and write it all out.

21
00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:03.270
但最重要的是，在纸上做这件事，而不是在电脑上。
But above all, practice doing this on
a piece of paper, not on a computer.

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.245
现场的你一直在等待的那部分是写作
The on-site, the part you've all
been waiting for, it's writing,

23
00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:10.174
取决于你对你的技能有多自信
depending on how confident
you feel in your skills.

24
00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:14.259
或者你对我有多自信我不会骗你的
Or how confident you feel in me
that I won't try to trick you.

25
00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.817
总是有诱惑人的诱惑但我今天不去
Which is always tempting to trick people,
but I'm not going to today.

26
00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:22.780
我们要解决 9 到 10 个问题
We're gonna cover about nine or
ten problems that I think represent

27
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.260
作为一个 JavaScript 工程师，作为一个 UI 工程师具有广泛的技能。
a good breadth of skills as a UI engineer,
as a JavaScript engineer.

28
00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:31.709
他们不会包罗万象的我不可能回答
They're not gonna be all encompassing,
I can't possibly answer and

29
00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.040
问你要问的每一个问题
ask every single question
you're ever gonna get.

30
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.243
但希望当你和真正的公司进行真正的生活访谈时
But hopefully, when you have real
life interviews with real companies,

31
00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.224
你会看到这些变化
you'll see variations of these.

32
00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.486
或者你只会看到变化
Or if you're only gonna see variations,

33
00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:45.533
了解我们在这里找的东西的技巧
understand the skills of
what we're looking for here.

34
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:48.560
要了解这些核心概念，你应该知道。
And understand these core concepts
that you should really know.

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.030
干得好
Nice job.

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.500
恭喜你下一轮就要开始了
Congratulations, you're
moving on to the next round.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.113
现在你要去现场了
You're now on to the on-site.

4
00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:10.538
现场就是人们在想采访的时候，
The on-site is,
when people think about interviewing,

5
00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:15.449
他们会想到现场，他们认为是粉饰，他们是这么想的。
they think on-site, they think
whiteboarding, that's what they think of.

6
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.660
没有人认为其他步骤。
Nobody thinks that the other steps.

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.044
但就像我们之前说的大多数人不会到达现场
But like we said earlier,
most people won't get to the on-site.

8
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.969
即使你这样做也会有点挑战性
Even if you do,
it's going to be a bit challenging and

9
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:26.969
我们今天要解决这个问题
we're going to try to solve that today.

10
00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.760
但是，真正进入现场是一个成就。
But really, getting to the on-site
is an achievement in itself.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.250
你应该为自己感到骄傲即使你把炸弹完全炸了
You should be proud of yourself if,
even if you bomb completely.

12
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.990
没关系我是说
That's okay.

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.869
至少你有机会去采访一些很棒的工程师
At least you have the opportunity to
interview with some really good engineers,

14
00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.409
但愿这真的是个好工程师
hopefully that really good engineers.

15
00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.280
希望你拿走一些东西，你会从中学到一些东西。
And hopefully you take something away and
you learn something from that.

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000
所以如果你这么做了，给自己一个回合。
So if you made it this far,
give yourself a round.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.619
干得好
Nice job.

18
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:46.170
你把它做成了外面
You made it to the outside.

19
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.619
现在我们来谈谈你想为现场采访准备的事情。
Now let's talk about the things you want
to prepare for, for the onsite interview.

20
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.509
在白板上的纸上编写没有计算机的代码。
practice writing code without a computer,
on a piece of paper on a whiteboard.

21
00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:59.710
如果你有一个，你有一个华丽的房子，或者我不知道的东西。
If you have one, you have a fancy house or
something I don't know.

22
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.070
我在旧金山的小思科合伙人里没有房间
I don't have room in my tiny
San Cisco partner for whiteboard.

23
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.109
所以我在纸上做一些事情。
So I do things on piece of paper.

24
00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:07.739
我们今天要做的所有工作都是在现场进行的。
And all the exercise we're going to
do today during the on-site portion.

25
00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.510
我想让你在纸上做一件事因为这就是你要做的
I want you to do on a piece of paper
because that's how you'll be doing it real

26
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.719
生命或白板。
life or whiteboard.

27
00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.150
如果你有自己的喜好但这些文件都是为了
If you happen to have one your fancy,
but do all these paper because

28
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.299
一般都不会有电脑帮你没有冬天的
generally there won't be any computers
help you there's no linters.

29
00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.890
没有互联网可以向上看，真的会让你减速。
There's no internet to look up and
honestly it slows you down.

30
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.189
写张纸比较灵活，因为我可以画，
Writing a piece paper is more
flexible because I can draw,

31
00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.650
我可以把东西交出去，我可以更灵活地思考一下。
I can cross stuff out and
I can think a bit more flexibly.

32
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.019
这就是你要做的事情
And that's what you'd be doing things.

33
00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:31.530
我得到了白板的焦虑
I get whiteboard anxiety.

34
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.900
我知道有人站在那儿看着我
I know someone standing there watching me,
so

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.090
最好还是喜欢解决问题，大声说出来。
it's better just to like practice solving
problems and saying them out loud.

36
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.750
另一个提示是要解决常规样本问题。
Another tip is to go over
general sample problems.

37
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.140
有点像我要给你的或者你可以上网查的
Kind of like the ones I'm gonna give
you or ones you can look up online.

38
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.520
练习不带电脑的人
Practice doing those
without a computer and

39
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.310
不要关注解决方案，关注您的情况。
don't focus on the solutions,
focus on how you got there.

40
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.920
我保证你可能不会再看到同样的问题了
Cuz I promise you probably won't see
the same questions over and over again.

41
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.390
你会看到一些你一直没看到的东西
You'll see some, there's always
be something you haven't seen.

42
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.200
重要的是了解如何分解问题和
It's important to learn how
to break down a problem and

43
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
说他们在具体问题上找的是什么 ?
say What are they looking for
in the specific problem?

44
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.769
我该如何打破这一问题，我怎么向某人解释呢 ?
How would I break that down,
how would I explain that to somebody?

45
00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:10.389
因为有时你会被困住你会被困住
Because at some point, you're gonna
get stuck, you're gonna get stuck and

46
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.770
你就会被冻结你也不知道下一步该怎么办
you're gonna get freezed, and
you don't know what to do next.

47
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.310
练习帮助缓解其中的一些情况。
And practicing helps
alleviate some of that.

48
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.469
问你的朋友来测试你
Ask your friends to test you.

49
00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.550
进行视频交谈，呼叫陌生人。
Do a video chat, call a stranger.

50
00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.610
实际上有一些公司会在现场采访你。
There are actually companies out there
that will Live interview you as practice.

51
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.560
利用这一点
Take advantage of that.

52
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.900
这是另一种情况。
It is a different scenario.

53
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.240
你就像我说的
You're like, I aced this.

54
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.750
我把这些问题都解决了
I got all these questions right.

55
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.389
我钉上了他们
I nailed them.

56
00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.210
杰姆他不知道他在说话
Jem, he doesn't know he's talking.

57
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.310
我比他聪明
I'm way smarter than him.

58
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400
这些问题我都解决了没问题
I solved all these problems, no problem.

59
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.189
然后你到白板上面有两个人看着你
And then you get up to the whiteboard and
there's two people watching you and

60
00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:42.789
你就像是
you're like, aah.

61
00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.500
如何实施二进制搜索?
How do I implement binary search?

62
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.199
我知道怎么做
I know how to do this.

63
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.800
我以前做过但你只是冻结了
I've done it before,
but you just freeze up.

64
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.289
所以找别人来测试你
So get someone else to test you.

65
00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:57.870
它改变了你对事物的看法
It changes your perspective on
things.And if they will ask what

66
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.069
技术上的问题会是怎样的呢 ?
style of technical questions
Is it going to be?

67
00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.580
将会是 Html， CSS，我们正在建造一些东西。
Is it going to be Html, CSS,
we're actually building something.

68
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.259
是否会是高级组件设计，就像我正在设计一个组件，
Is it going to be high level component
design like I'm designing a component that

69
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.110
其他工程师会用吗
other engineers will use?

70
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.009
他们会是算法问题吗
Are they going to be
algorithmic questions?

71
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.909
通常，采访者会告诉你，他们会告诉你要期待什么，
Usually, the interviewer will tell you and
they'll tell you kind of what to expect,

72
00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.900
就像一些算法或者他们会有的
like some algorithms some of this or
they'll be.

73
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.170
它们都是你要解决的 JavaScript 问题。
They're all just relevent JavaScript
problems that you're gonna solve.

74
00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.490
请尝试提前进行评估。
Try to get assessment ahead of time.

75
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.329
如果它是很多算法，研究算法。
If it's a lot of algorithms,
study algorithms.

76
00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.789
如果是很多 JavaScript 问题
If it's a lot of JavaScript questions,

77
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.710
确保你知道 JavaScript 基金会之类的
make sure you know JavaScript foundations,
things like that.

78
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.969
就像这样问一次
Just try to like ask at a time.

79
00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.457
如果你知道会发生什么会帮助你摆脱一些紧张情绪
It'll help you get rid of some of
the nervousness if you know what's coming.

80
00:03:39.914 --> 00:03:44.310
这就是你在事业中所做的事情。
So, this is something you
will do in your career.

81
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.050
作为一名工程师
As an engineer.

82
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.800
您可能永远不会进行电话屏幕或必须创建代码测试或
You may not ever do a phone screen or
have to create a code tests or

83
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.520
甚至在电话里找个候选人
even talk to a candidate on the phone.

84
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.449
如果你还没有，你会去采访一个人。
You will interview someone,
if you haven't already.

85
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.740
我真正想让你在采访中消失的是共鸣。
What I really want you to take away
as the interviewer is empathy.

86
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.039
记住接受采访的感觉，记住它的烂程度。
Remember what it's like to interview and
remember how much it sucks.

87
00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.650
尽量做尽可能最好的面试的人
And try to be the person that gives
the best possible interview as possible.

88
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.560
是的你可以这么做
Yes, that's possible with you.

89
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.849
你觉得这是完全错误的
You figured it completely wrong,

90
00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.870
你想让他们走开那是个好经验
you want them to walk away saying,
that was a good experience.

91
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.979
我学到了一些东西
I learned some things,

92
00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.600
显然我有一些学习要做才有资格得到这份工作
clearly I have some learnings to do
before I'm qualified to get this job.

93
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.189
但你想摆脱这种经历吗
But you want to walk away
with that experience?

94
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.720
不是那个 Jen 是个混蛋他根本帮不上
Not that Jen was a jerk,he
didn't help at all,he

95
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.990
一直在电脑上打字
was typing on his computer all the time.

96
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.019
我觉得他在推特上取笑我也许
He's I think he's on Twitter,
making fun of me maybe, like,

97
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:34.360
是啊我想知道
yeah, which I want to know.

98
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.159
你想让他们
Like, you want them to

99
00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.949
有最好的经验，因为采访很烂，我们可以做得更好。
have the best possible experience because
interviewing sucks and we can do better.

100
00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.810
只是我们在桌边的另一边
It's just a We get there on
the other side of the table and

101
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.350
就像我们忘记了工作时间里的一切
it's like we forget what it's
like in all the hours of work.

102
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.480
就好像要到这个人去的地方
It's like to get to where this person is.

103
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.409
记住你是七八个人中的一个甚至 10 岁
And remember that you are one of seven or
eight people, maybe even 10 or

104
00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.360
他们会在白天跟你说的
20 that they're gonna
talk to you in the day.

105
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.590
所以别试图站出来
So don't try to stand out and

106
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.659
记住采访不是说你有多聪明
remember interviews are not
about showing how smart you are.

107
00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.040
你想说这个人很好
You're trying to say is this
person Good to work with.

108
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.399
我是否明白他们的想法 ?
Do I understand the way they think?

109
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.500
我是否同意他们解决问题的方法 ?
Do I agree with the way
they solve problems?

110
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.720
这就是我认为与这家公司合身的一种方式吗 ?
Is it a way that I think will
fit in with this company?

111
00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.500
首先要做的是确定这些问题是否与角色相关。
The first thing to do is make sure they
questions are relevent to the role.

112
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.189
这些问题是你必须在现实生活中解决的吗 ?
Are these questions that you've had
to solve in a real life scenario?

113
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.100
如果这样可能是个好问题
If so it's probably a good question.

114
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.339
这些都是你之前要解决的问题。
These are this is a problem
you've had to solve before.

115
00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:29.129
但如果是任意的算法问题如果你想找
But if it's an arbitrary algorithm problem
that's fine if you want if you look for

116
00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.550
有人来记忆问题和解决方法但却不知道
someone to memorize problems and
solutions, but it's not gonna really tell

117
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.110
他们怎么想的告诉我他们擅长储存算法
me how they think it tells me they're
good at memorizing algorithms.

118
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.870
我想让你的问题变成边缘案例
I want questions that
you've run into edge cases.

119
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.769
如何呈现具有百万项的列表，或类似的内容 ?
How do I render a list with a million
items, or something like that?

120
00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:44.069
我怎么在这件事上撒尿
How do I paginate something?

121
00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.480
我们做的 UI 工程师的事情。
Things that we've done as UI engineers.

122
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.519
这些都与作为一个 UI 工程师有关。
These are relevant to being a UI engineer.

123
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.230
请备份采访者，再次，感同身受。
Have backup interviewers, again, empathy.

124
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.319
他们花了很长时间，工作多，压力很大，
They spend a long time and
a lot of work, and a lot of stress and

125
00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.259
如果你想去现场我们就会重新安排
anxiety to get to the on-site If you're
like, we're gonna reschedule because

126
00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.600
blahh blahs lahs 生病或反应在最后一分钟
blah blah blahs out sick or
react to pull someone at the last minute

127
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.389
他没有准备好接受他们的首脑们的一个问题
who was not prepared to give
an interview their heads down a problem.

128
00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.149
他们会像 JavaScript 面试问题一样去谷歌
They're going to Google some like
JavaScript interview questions

129
00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:12.589
快速备份采访者。
real quick have backup interviewers.

130
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.800
让他们知道他们的支援
Let them know that their the backup or

131
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.410
最好有两个人去面试
have ideally have two
people do an interview.

132
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.399
我总是建议人们
I always recommend to people.

133
00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.339
做一个采访因为一个，它消除了偏见。
Doing an interview because one,
it eliminates bias.

134
00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.180
我不喜欢那家伙
Two I didn't like that guy.

135
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.110
他是老鹰迷
He's an Eagles fan.

136
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.470
我不喜欢老鹰队
I don't like Eagles fan.

137
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.839
但开发商说，我觉得他们做得不错。
But developers say well,
I thought they did pretty well.

138
00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.899
我觉得你有点偏见
I think you have a little bit of bias.

139
00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.529
但一般都有两个人
But generally try to have two people.

140
00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.139
如果您的公司具有工程规模，可以做到这一点。
If your company has the size
of engineering to do that.

141
00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.379
更能让更多的人接受采访
It really helps get up more
even A more even interview.

142
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.600
整日都在书里
Book the room for the entire day.

143
00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.180
同样地，你强调了机械师的压力，他们在出汗，
Again, you're stressed out the mechanics
stressed out, they're sweating,

144
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.730
他们很紧张可能是他们的问题
they're nervous, they may have got
the problem right they may have gotten

145
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.480
错了他们还不知道你还不知道呢
wrong they don't know yet
you won't know until finish.

146
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.069
但让他们四处移动和抓住背包之类的东西
But having them move around and
grab their backpack and all this stuff and

147
00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:57.680
转个转
shuffle around.

148
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.430
这不是有用的
That's not helpful.

149
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.240
让他们订白天的房间
Have them book the room for the day.

150
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.360
确保你有充足的时间休息浴室吃午饭
Make sure you have plenty of time for
breaks, bathroom, lunch,

151
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.149
如果他们整天都在那儿
if they're there all day.

152
00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:08.579
确保他们有饮料和零食
Make sure they have drinks, snacks
like anything they need to make them

153
00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:10.050
舒服得像个舒服的人
comfortable as comfortable as possible.

154
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.620
因为面试很烂但你能帮我做得更好
Because again, interviewing sucks,
but you can help make it better

155
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.579
很容易就能友好地提供大量的时间
really easily just by being friendly and
giving plenty of time.

156
00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:17.259
但最重要的是
But above all,

157
00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.259
记住，它不是关于你在房间另一边的人的事。
remember, it is not about you is about
the person on the other side of the room.

158
00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:26.980
有句老话说 A 玩家雇佣 A 手
There's an old saying that
A player's hire A players,

159
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.639
B 球员雇用 C 球员， C 球员雇用 D 球员等。
B players hire C players, C players
hire D players and so on and so forth.

160
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.709
因为我们采访的时候，我们经常喜欢这个比我更聪明的人。
Because known when we interview we
often like this person smarter than me.

161
00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:36.920
我很害怕
I am intimidated by that.

162
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.290
当你的自我进入的过程中
As your ego gets in the way, and

163
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.189
我说这些是因为我犯了这一罪，并询问了部落问题。
I say these things because i have been
guilty of this and asked trivia questions.

164
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:46.790
我过去接受过糟糕的采访，因为我的自我是这样。
I have given poor interviews in the past,
because my ego is in the way.

165
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.459
不你想和比你聪明的人合作
No, you want to work with people
that are smarter than you,

166
00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:50.519
因为他们会让你更聪明
because they'll make you smarter.

167
00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.509
他们不会让你看起来很糟
They are not going to make you look bad.

168
00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.439
这就是你所担心的，但是他们会让你变得更聪明。
That is what you are worried about, but
they are going to make you smarter.

169
00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.920
最理想的是每个人都比你聪明
Ideally, everybody's smarter than you and

170
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.810
他们会帮你加薪因为你想成为最好的采访人
they help raise you up because you want
to be the best interviewer you can.

171
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.060
这就是你参加这个课程的原因吧
That's why you're taking this course,
right?

172
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.100
所以，如果你还记得同情的话，你可以抛弃我所说的所有东西。
So again, you can discard everything
else I've said if you remember empathy.

173
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.029
别忘了它在另一边是什么样的
Just remember what it's like
on the other side of that.

174
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:10.860
尤其是当你和公司一起工作时
And it's really hard to do especially
when you've been with the company for

175
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.569
几年的时间我都不记得采访的内容
a couple of years cuz you're like, I don't
even remember what it's like to interview.

176
00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:16.389
但如果是这样的话就去面试
But if that's the case,
go out and interview and

177
00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:19.100
记住它是什么样的，你会有更多的感同身受。
remember what it's like, You will
come back with a lot more empathy.

1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.750
所以如果你要找候选人这些都是他们要问你的问题
So if you're calling a candidate,
these are questions they're gonna ask you,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.900
或者你应该准备好回答这个问题
or you should be prepared to answer these.

3
00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:11.349
面试过程有几个步骤 ?
How many steps are in
the interview process?

4
00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.160
我想知道
I wanna know.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.640
有公司我拒绝接受采访我接到电话
There are companies that I've declined
the interview for, I had a phone call,

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.550
我说面试的步骤有多好吗
it was nice and cordial, and
I said how many steps in the interview?

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.320
有个电话屏蔽然后还有一个电话屏幕
Well there's a phone screening and
then there's another phone screen and

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.620
然后还有七到八回合
then seven to eight rounds alongside.

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.170
假设我已经过去了
Let's say I'm pass.

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.939
我只是在做这些事就像我不想接受采访一样
I'm just doing this for of course anyways,
like I don't really wanna interview.

11
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.689
但我肯定不想花三四天的时间
But I certainly don't wanna take three,
four days of my time.

12
00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.890
但他们应该知道如果他们不认识
But they should know that after that,
if they don't know them,

13
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.229
他们没有一个好的过程
they don't have a good process and

14
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.390
这可能不是最好的面试经验
that may not be the best
interviewing experience.

15
00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:45.090
这很有趣
And this is funny.

16
00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.479
事实上这对我来说很有趣对你来说这很有趣
Actually, it's funny to me,
it'll be funny to you in a second.

17
00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.329
你会觉得很难采访到大的公司，所以谷歌，
Would you think it's hard to interview
at the big FAANG companies, so Google,

18
00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.299
苹果，微软，还是创业公司 ?
Apple, Microsoft, or a startup?

19
00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.003
我觉得在大公司面试有点容易
I think interviewing at the big
companies is a little easier.

20
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.070
挑战是否更艰巨 ?
Are the challenges harder?

21
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.579
也许你知道你要在公司做些什么因为他们已经做了
Maybe but you know what you're going to
get at the companies because they've done

22
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.579
数十年甚至几十年
this for years, decades even.

23
00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.349
他们有一个招聘经理的过程。
They have a process for
the hiring manager talks to you.

24
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:12.439
然后这个人来了
And then this person comes on,

25
00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.200
他们有一个整体的人，他们有一个科学的。
they have a whole panel of people,
they have it down to a science.

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.710
Startups 很容易，可能很难。
Startups could be easy, could be hard.

27
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.099
你不知道你要得到什么
You don't know what you're going to get.

28
00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.859
因为通常是像我这样的人
Because it's usually some guy like me.

29
00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.000
就像垃圾一样我今天有个面试
It's like crap, I got an interview today.

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.159
让我来为 JavaScript 工程师找个问题
Let me Google interview questions for
JavaScript engineers like, yeah,

31
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.680
这个看起来很酷
this one looks hard, cool.

32
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.539
这就是你经常得到的东西
That's what you get a lot of time.

33
00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.420
所以了解过程和
So understand the process and

34
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.060
如果你接受采访请你有个过程
if you're giving the interview,
please have a process.

35
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.890
就像我反复说的那样因为这很重要
Like I will say this repeatedly
because it's important.

36
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.021
你在给别人做工作时改变了别人的生活
You are changing someone's life
when you make them a job offer,

37
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:48.299
当你采访他们的时候
when you interview them.

38
00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.020
你改变了他们的生活
You are changing the course of their life.

39
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.569
你说真的
Like, take it seriously.

40
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.890
别专横问你的问题
Don't be arbitrary with your questions.

41
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.640
如果我要出发的话，我就开始在谷歌或者
If I had to start off, I would start and
try to interview at Google or

42
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.329
就像这样
something like that.

43
00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.359
我很可能是第一次失败
I would fail wildly
probably the first time.

44
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:03.290
但他们有这个过程我知道
But they have this process and
I know that, okay,

45
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.171
这些是他们问的问题，我可以研究。
these are the types of questions that
they ask, I can study for these.

46
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:10.810
启动，你不知道自己会得到什么。
A startup,
you don't know what you're going to get.

47
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.734
就像你在一家小公司工作一样
So as if you're working
in a small company,

48
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.657
比如有一个过程有你在时间前的这些问题。
like have a process have these
questions you have in front of time.

49
00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:19.074
但最重要的是，至少知道要执行的步骤数
But above all, have know at least
the number of steps you're going

50
00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:20.879
在面试过程中
to be in the interview process.

51
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.729
这不太不合理
That's not too unreasonable.

52
00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.610
另一个问题是你的工程队有多大 ?
Another question is how big
is your engineering team?

53

也许知道这种事

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.969
我想知道我和两万多名工程师

with 20,000 other engineers or

55
00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.579
我和五个工程师一起工作吗
am I working with five engineers?

56
00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.979
它改变了动态。
It changes the dynamic.

57
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.030
它改变了我对一家公司的影响
It changes the influence I'm
gonna have on a company.

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.420
我要采访哪个团队 ?
Which team would I be interviewing for?

59
00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.229
我要做什么
What am I gonna be doing?

60
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.150
这个很直接但是
This one's pretty straightforward but

61
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.219
你会对那些无法告诉你的人大吃一惊
you'd be surprised the number of
people that couldn't tell you.

62
00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.920
他们会喜欢的我们会知道的
They'll be like, we'll see.

63
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.590
你为什么跟我说话
Why are you talking to me?

64
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.599
你显然有开口
You clearly have openings.

65

贵公司的文化是什么 ?

是很轻松很容易吗
Is it it's very relaxed and easy going?

我们是作为一个团队来庆祝胜利吗

together as a team?

70

我们每晚都出去吃饭
We go out for dinner every night.

71
00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:07.969
有些人也许会和你一起，有些人可能不会。
Some of these may vibe with you,
some of them may not.

72
00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.229
你应该准备好让一个候选人来问你这些问题。
You should be prepared for
a candidate to ask you these questions.

73
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.030
我喜欢的是谁是你的竞争对手
What I like is, who are your competitors?

74
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.909
这种情况告诉你它是什么样的公司。
That kind of tells you what
sort of company it is.

75
00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.329
我们就像对付工业巨头一样
We're like we're going against
the titans of industry.

76
00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.319
你们两个人多大 ?

不我有个孩子在路上
No, I've got a kid on the way.

80
00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.195
我真的不想在小启动时冒这个风险。
I really don't want to take
that risk in a small startup.

81
00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:34.060
这很公平但是他们准备问你这些问题
That's fair, but be prepared that they're
going to ask you these sort of questions

82
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.360
以及我在做什么项目
and what sort of projects what I work on.

83
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.507
作为招聘经理招聘人员，您可能应该了解他们所做的一些事情。
As a hiring manager recruiter, you should
probably know some of the things they're

84

尤其是雇佣一个高级的人
probably gonna work on,
especially for hiring someone senior.

我要承认，我不需要做，我不想做数据库迁移。
I like admittedly, I don't need to do,

我不想手动将数据转换为 Excel 电子表格。
And I don't want to do manually converting
data into an Excel spreadsheet.

89
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.990
你可能会说，嘿，你知道，我们会做些这些
You might say, hey, you know,
we're going to do some of this and

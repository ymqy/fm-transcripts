1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.129
所以我们采访了前面的工程师。
So we interviewed for front engineers.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.509
这当然是为了奠定基础。
This course is to help
lay that groundwork.

3
00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.096
我不能保证到最后我就会回答每一次可能的面试
I can't guarantee by the end, I will have
answered every single possible interview

4
00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:15.535
你会不会在你的生活中出现这种可能性是不可能的
question you will ever get in your life,
that is not possible.

5
00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:19.873
但我能保证你能更好地了解
But what I can guarantee is you're gonna
have a better understanding of what

6
00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:24.571
面试是，应该是什么，专门面向前方的工程师。
interviewing is, and what it should be,
specifically for frontend engineers.

7
00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.570
这个过程有点不寻常，因为它是从两部分中得知的。
And this course is a little unusual
because it's told from two parts.

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.570
从候选人的角度来看
It's told from
the candidate's perspective.

9
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.109
如果你愿意的话
That would be the interviewee if you will,
but

10
00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.289
我喜欢候选人库会有点乱
I like candidate cuz
it'll get a little messy.

11
00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:41.439
它是从这个角度讲的，因为你最了解的是
And it's told from that perspective
because that's the perspective most of you

12
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:42.630
都是从这来的
are coming from.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.979
你是说我有很多关于面试的焦虑
You're saying, I have a lot of
anxiety about interviewing.

14
00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.249
它是任意的，很糟糕，这是一个漫长的过程。
It's arbitrary, it's terrible,
it's a long process.

15
00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.493
我想说的是我想说你是怎么处理这些问题的
Yeah, I wanna settle that, I wanna say,
here's how you approach these problems

16
00:00:51.493 --> 00:00:54.000
你也许会看到这里是如何解决这些问题的
that you're probably gonna see and
here's how to solve them.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.738
这就是面试期间的表现
And here's how to behave
during the interview and

18
00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:01.567
这些都是采访的对象
these are the things to
expect from an interview but

19
00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:06.655
一个扭曲的，一个 Jem 的扭曲，有专利，有专利。
a little bit more unusual in a twist,
a Jem twist, patent pending.

20
00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:09.939
我要从一个采访者的角度来回答问题
I'm gonna give the questions from
the perspective of an interviewer.

21
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.459
所以我现在问你，你不用举手，你什么也不用说。
So I ask you now, you don't have to raise
your hand, you don't have to say anything.

22
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:20.260
但是你花了多少时间去采访人呢 ?
But how much time have you spent
studying how to interview people?

23
00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:25.117
大概没那么多
Probably not that much.

24
00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:30.658
如果是的话，你的公司是否给你一个采访人的课程 ?
If at all, does your company give you
a course on how to interview people?

25
00:01:32.212 --> 00:01:34.371
有些人有，有的没有。
Some do, some don't.

26
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:39.390
对比你花了几个小时来研究采访的时间。
Now contrast that against how many hours
you've spent studying the interview.

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.615
那里有个断开的地方
Hm, there's a disconnect somewhere.

28
00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:44.909
我不知道为什么面试这么艰难
I wonder why interviews are so hard.

29
00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.237
因为我们很注重通过面试
Because we focus so
much on passing an interview, but

30
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:49.993
我们从没想过我们什么时候在桌子的另一边
we never think about when we're
on the other side of the table.

31
00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:51.951
为了创造这个课程，我和很多人交谈过。
And to create this course,
I talked to a lot of people.

32
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.939
我和 Netflix，谷歌和 Facebook 的人交谈。
I talk to people at Netflix,
and Google, and Facebook.

33
00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.079
我和那些在小型创业公司工作的人交谈
And I talk to people who
work at small startups,

34
00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.329
我和那些在中型创业公司工作的人交谈
I talk to people who work
at medium-sized startups.

35
00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:00.930
我出去采访了
I went out and I interviewed,

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.730
我同意如果大家都知道有点不愉快但我去了
which I agree if we all know it's
a bit unpleasant, but I went on

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.960
因为我想知道哪些公司在问这几天。
an interview because I wanted to find out
what are companies asking these days.

38
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.340
他们想知道的问题的类型是什么 ?
What are the type of
questions they wanna know?

39
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.637
他们在工程师里找什么
What are they looking for in an engineer?

40
00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:14.818
但我也想知道人们是怎么对待我的
But also I wanna know,
how did people treat me?

41
00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:15.853
我喜欢什么
What did I like?

42
00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:17.293
我不喜欢什么
What did I dislike?

43
00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:18.719
我们从没想过这个
We never think about this.

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.069
那天我在推特上发过消息也许我会和你分享
I tweeted this out the other day and maybe
I'll share it with you at some point.

45
00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.150
但这是典型的面试经验。
But here's a typical
interviewing experience.

46
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.156
走吧走吧
Walk in.

47
00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.893
有人要求你执行，我不知道，
Someone asked you to implement,
I don't know,

48
00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:35.099
一个白板上的二进制搜索树 [ SOUND ]
a binary search tree on the whiteboard and
already you're like, [SOUND] but

49
00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.936
你这么做是因为你花了三个月的时间来面试
you did it because you spent three months
studying for this interview, and you pass.

50
00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:41.277
你的感觉糟透了
You're like, that was terrible.

51
00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:43.800
我不会那么做的那太可怕了
[LAUGH] I will never do that,
that was awful.

52
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.310
我很高兴我能通过我的提议现在我要去吃免费午餐了
I'm glad I got through, I got the offer,
now I'm going to eat my free lunch.

53
00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.150
然后，六个月后，有人进来了，有点紧张。
And then, six months later,
someone comes in, a little nervous.

54
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.460
他们喜欢，欢迎加入 Acme Corp.
They're like, welcome to Acme Corp.

55
00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.159
现在你知道我要你做什么了，我要你在白板上执行一个。
Now you know what I want you to do, I want
you to implement a on the whiteboard.

56
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.729
这是一个非常快速的查找素数的方法。
That's a very fast way of
finding prime numbers.

57
00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.780
但你不会知道除非你研究
But you wouldn't know that unless
you study because it's not

58
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.189
每天都有你用的东西
something you use every day.

59
00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.659
但这有点像大学的嗡嗡会
But it's kind of like University hazing.

60
00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.789
这一切都糟透了但这个循环一直持续下去
It all sucks but the cycle just
keeps going and going and going.

61
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.120
因为我们忘记了在餐桌的另一边
Because we forget what it's like to
be on the other side of the table,

62
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.990
我们忘了基本的同情
we are forgetting that basic empathy.

63
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.500
所以我想从采访者的角度来看这个课程。
So I wanna tell this course from the
perspective of the interviewer as well.

64
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.659
听起来不错
Sound good, yeah.

65
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.920
我想挑战你回到你的工作地点
And I wanna challenge you to go
back to your place of work and

66
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.925
比如说我们怎么不去采访人呢 ?
say, how come we never study
how to interview people?

67
00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:32.770
我们怎么能不能有这种普通的卢布呢
How can we not have this common rubric?

68
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.093
我想开始对话因为采访不是很棒
I wanna start that conversation
because interviewing is not great.

69
00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:37.099
我想我们能搞定
I think we can fix it.

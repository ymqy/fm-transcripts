00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.354
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：现在是更好的部分。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: And now the better parts.

3
00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:08.939
这就是Antoine de Saint-Exupery
So this is Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

4
00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.939
在航空业非常危险的时候，他是一名飞行员。
He was an aviator back at the time when aviation was really dangerous.

5
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.149
我们以前就是这么称呼飞行员的，但他是个飞行员。
That's what we used to call pilots, but he was an aviator.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.679
这真的很危险，因为飞机坠毁了。
It was really dangerous because the planes crashed.

7
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.760
在他的职业生涯中他经历了几次车祸
And he experienced several crashes during his career and

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910
几乎所有人都活了下来。
survived almost all of them.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.299
他曾经试图创造从巴黎到西贡的空速记录
He was once trying to set the air speed record from Paris to Saigon and

10
00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:38.469
他的飞机坠毁在埃及，在撒哈拉沙漠开罗附近。
his plane crashed in Egypt, near Cairo out in the Sahara Desert.

11
00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.880
他没有准备好在沙漠中生存。
And he was not prepared for survival in the desert.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.630
他在那里表现得非常糟糕，遭受了严重的脱水。
He did very badly there, suffered terrible dehydration.

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.380
脱水得太厉害以至于他停止了出汗，
Dehydrated so much that he stopped sweating,

14
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.780
在沙漠里做这件事真的很危险。
which is a really dangerous thing to do in the desert.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.039
遭受了可怕的幻觉。
Suffered terrible hallucinations.

16
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.090
幸运的是，他被一个懂得如何治疗严重疾病的人救了出来。
Fortunately he was rescued by someone who understood how to treat severe

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.840
脱水，他活了下来，康复了。
dehydration and he survived and recovered.

18
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.980
随着战争的开始移居美国，成为一名作家
Moved to America as the war is beginning, becomes a writer and

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.250
原来他是一位才华横溢的作家。
turns out he's a brilliant writer.

20
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.379
他写了最著名的儿童书籍之一，“小王子”。
He writes one of the most famous children's books, The Little Prince.

21
00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.799
它讲的是一个被困在沙漠中的飞行员
Which is about an aviator who is stranded in the desert

22
00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.230
他被一个住在小行星上的奇怪的小男孩拜访，他有自杀倾向。
who is visited by a strange little boy who lives on an asteroid and is suicidal.

23
00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.640
就像所有最好的儿童书籍一样，这不是一本真正的儿童书籍，是的。
Like all the best children's books, it's not really a children's book, yeah.

24
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.859
他还写了其他的书。
And he wrote other books, too.

25
00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.799
他写了一些关于航空的很好的书
He wrote some very good books about aviation books and

26
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859
针对成年人的书籍。
books aimed at grownups.

27
00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.120
在其中一篇文章中，他写了史上最好的句子之一。
In one of them, he has one of the best sentences ever written.

28
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.960
他说，似乎完美并不是在没有更多事情要做的时候才达到的。
He says it seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to

29
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.189
加，但当没有更多要减去的东西时，这就太棒了。
add, but when there is nothing more to subtract, which is just brilliant.

30
00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.859
我看过这句话一遍又一遍地重复引用。
I've seen this quoted requoted over and over again.

31
00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.520
它在所有的地方和工程设计中都被使用，
It's used all over the place and in engineering design,

32
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.030
任何创造性的需要某种纪律的东西。
anything that's creative that requires some kind of discipline.

33
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.629
这只是一句精彩的引语
It's just a brilliant quote and

34
00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:09.960
他在谈论飞机的设计，但似乎什么都谈。
he's talking about the design of airplanes but it seems to talk about everything.

35
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.240
我认为这对于编程来说特别有意义，
And I think it's especially telling for programming,

36
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.500
因为我们和完美有一种特殊的关系，对吧？
because we have a special relationship with perfection, right?

37
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.759
我们的程序必须完美否则就不能正常工作。
That our programs have to be perfect or they're not gonna work correctly.

38
00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.610
他给了我们一些关于如何达到完美的洞察力。
And he gives us some insight as to how perfection is attained.

39
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.960
它是通过删除东西，而不是通过添加东西。
It's by removing things, it's not by adding things.

40
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.520
我认为我们也可以将它应用于编程语言。
And I think we can also apply it to programming languages.

41
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.159
因为我们在那里有类似的事情
Because we have similar things going on there

42
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.280
我们的大多数编程语言倾向于添加东西。
that most of our programming languages tend to want to add things.

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.729
但我认为大部分可以通过删除东西来改善。
But I think most of them could be improved by removing things.

44
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.159
这就是好的部分的原则从何而来。
And that's where the principle of the good parts comes from.

45
00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.530
如果一个功能有时有用有时很危险
That if a feature is sometimes useful and sometimes dangerous and

46
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.860
如果有更好的选择。
if there is a better option.

47
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.069
总是使用更好的选择。
Always use the better option.

48
00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.229
令我惊讶的是，这是一个有争议的声明。
And it surprises me that this is a controversial statement.

49
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:06.289
现在有很多人说我不想用更好的选择。
Now there are lots of people out there who say I don't wanna use a better option.

50
00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.990
你不能让我用更好的选择。
You can't make me use the better option.

51
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.889
好像变得更好就足够了，但事实并非如此。
It's like it being better should be enough,but it's not.

52
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.449
我认为这来自于一个根本性的误解
I think that comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about

53
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.210
我们做的是什么。
what it is that we do.

54
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.180
我们并不是为了使用语言的每一个特性而付费的。
We are not paid to use every feature of the language.

55
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.020
在项目结束时，永远不会有经理拿着剪贴板说
At the end of a project there is never a manager with a clipboard saying

56
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.728
确实使用了WITH语句，您是否省略了任何分号？
did use a with statement, did you leave out any semicolons?

57
00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:31.935
您在运算符XII中使用逗号吗？
Did you use commas in operator XII?.

58
00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:36.479
不，没人会这么做。
No, no, nobody's doing that.

59
00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.030
我们受雇于编写运行良好的程序
We are paid to write programs that work well and

60
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.139
没有错误，但这就是问题所在。
are free of error, but that's what it's all about.

61
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.770
现在没有错误了，这是从哪里来的？
Now free of error, where did that come from?

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.819
结果是没有错误的始终是第一要求。
What turns out free of error has always been the first requirement.

63
00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.860
只是我们很少做到这一点，
It's just we so rarely attain it,

64
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.740
很容易忘记这是最重要的事情。
it's easy to forget that it's the most important thing.

65
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.420
&gt；&gt；扬声器2：我想这就是为什么它从来没有得到支付。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's why it's never gotten paid, I guess.

66
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.740
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所以好的编程语言应该教你。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So good programming language should teach you.

67
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.889
我建议大家尽可能多地学习语言。
I recommend everybody learn as many languages as you can.

68
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.009
因为每一种语言都会给你一些新的视角，
Because every language will give you some new perspective on something,

69
00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.650
也许会把你推向一个新的范式。
maybe push you into a new paradigm.

70
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.629
你可以把你学到的东西
And you can take the things that you learned and

71
00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.490
将它应用于你知道的所有其他语言。
apply it to all the other languages you know.

72
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.360
每个人都应该学习尽可能多的语言。
Everybody should learn as many languages as they can.

73
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.100
在我的职业生涯中教给我最多的语言是JavaScript。
And the language in my career that has taught me the most has been JavaScript.

74
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.600
我花了一段时间从语言中学习，因为，
And it took a while for me to to learn from the language, because well,

75
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.879
我在JavaScript中犯了你可能犯的每一个错误。
I made every mistake in JavaScript that you could make.

76
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.389
从第一个开始，最糟糕的一个。
Starting with the first one, the worst one.

77
00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.240
在我开始写作之前，我认为我不需要学习这门语言，
I didn't think I needed to learn the language before I started writing in it,

78
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.370
以至于我如此鄙视它。
that I had so much contempt for it.

79
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.740
当我第一次看到JavaScript时，我认为这是我见过的最愚蠢的事情。
The first time I saw JavaScript I thought it was the stupidest thing I'd ever seen.

80
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.329
结果发现，
And it turns out,

81
00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:48.220
我并不是完全错了，但我也不是完全对的。
I wasn't completely wrong, but I wasn't completely right either.

82
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.199
最终，我做到了
Eventually, I did and

83
00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.319
我在写JavaScript的时候一直在咒骂，这让我非常生气。
I was cursing all the time I was writing a JavaScript that made me very, very angry.

84
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.259
所以最终，我决定学习这门语言。
So eventually, I decided to learn the language.

85
00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.610
所以我得到了标准，你可以从网站上免费下载
So I got the standard, which you get free off of the site and

86
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.980
读了它，惊讶地发现里面有Lambdas。
read it, and was surprised to discover that it had lambdas in it.

87
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.170
如果它有第一类函数作为具有词汇闭包的第一类值，
If it had functions with first class as first class values with lexical closure,

88
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.920
我不知道它在里面。
which I had no idea that it was in there.

89
00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.730
布兰登故意放进去的。
Brendan put it in there intentionally.

90
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.089
这不是偶然进入语言的东西，但是
That's not something that gets into the language by accident, but

91
00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.329
他没告诉任何人。
he didn't tell anybody.

92
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.656
所以我在阅读标准时发现了这一点，
And so I discovered it in reading the standard and was wow,

93
00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:31.240
这改变了一切。
this changes everything.

94
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.209
在这一点上，我与语言的关系发生了变化。
And at that point my relationship with the language changed.

95
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.009
在这一点上，他终于能够开始教我一些东西
And at that point, he was able to finally start teaching me things and

96
00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.529
他教会了我很多东西。
he has taught me a lot.

97
00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.220
所以我用JavaScript做的一件事就是编写JSLint。
So one of the things I did with JavaScript was I wrote JSLint.

98
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.769
因为我需要一个工具来帮助我
Because I needed a tool to help me

99
00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:50.199
避免使用该语言的所有陷阱。
avoid all of the traps that are in that language.

100
00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.810
他们是来打败我的。
That are there to defeat me.

101
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.709
而且JSLint在JavaScript方面比我聪明得多。
And JSLint turns out is much smarter about JavaScript than I am.

102
00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:02.389
我最初的直觉是什么是语言的好特性什么是坏的
My initial intuitions about what were good features of languages what were bad

103
00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.529
是极其不可靠的。
were extremely unreliable.

104
00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.509
而JSLint总是非常擅长
Whereas JSLint was always very good at

105
00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.370
总是引导我找到正确的观点。
always directing me to the correct point of view.

106
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:16.949
为了找出错误，我们可以机械地做什么？
What is it that we can do mechanically in order to find mistakes?

107
00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.043
因为这就是我需要做的，为了让我的程序更完美。
Because that's what I need to do in order to try to make my programs more perfect.

108
00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:25.550
JSLint教会了我大量的编程知识。
And JSLint has taught me an enormous amount about programming.

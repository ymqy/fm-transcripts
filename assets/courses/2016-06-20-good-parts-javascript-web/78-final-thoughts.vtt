2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:05.250
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯：让我们谈谈责任。
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Let's talk about responsibility.

3
00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:11.429
当你编程时，你对谁负责？
Who are you responsible to when you're programming?

4
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.449
这就是我的答案
Well this is my answer,

5
00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.629
这就是我认为我在编写代码时应该对其负责的人。
this is who I think I am responsible to when I'm writing code.

6
00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:20.399
我的首要责任是对人民。
My number one responsibility is to The People.

7
00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.480
给那些不得不用我的软件的可怜的混蛋。
To the poor bastards who have to use my software.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.019
我想为他们工作得很好，我不想让他们沮丧，
I want to work really well for them, I don't want to frustrate them,

9
00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.100
我不想混淆他们，我不想伤害他们，
I don't want to confuse them, I don't want to hurt them,

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.929
我不想让他们走向毁灭，我想给他们尽可能最好的体验，
I don't want to lead them to ruin, I want to give them the best experience possible,

11
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.820
我想尽我所能让他们的生活变得更好。
I want to make their lives better to the extent that I can.

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.420
我们想象在软件行业，我们正在让世界变得更美好
We imagine in the software industry that we're making the world a better place

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
尽管有所有明显的相反证据，
despite all the obvious evidence to the contrary,

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.409
我们真的很想相信这一点，但我们至少应该试着让它成为现实
we'd really want to believe that but we should at least try to make it true for

15
00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.109
正在使用我们的东西的人，因为他们正在使用它。
the people who are using our stuff as they're using it.

16
00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.020
我们至少应该这么做。
We should at least do that.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.750
我见过这样的团队，他们蔑视他们的用户，他们讨厌他们的用户，
I've seen teams where they have contempt for their users, they hate their users,

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.789
用户总是抱怨，他们不知道如何使用他们的东西，
the user's always complaining, they don't understand how to use their stuff,

19
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.969
他们不欣赏我们的天才，他们愚蠢，他们是可怕的人，
they don't appreciate our genius, they're stupid, they're awful people,

20
00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.849
恨他们，我认为这是完全有毒的，这是不可原谅的。
hate them, which I think is totally toxic, that it's inexcusable.

21
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.989
我们永远不应该那样想。
We should never be thinking like that.

22
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.460
我们所做的一切都应该为人类服务。
Everything that we do should be in service to humanity.

23
00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.099
第二，团队。
Number two, The team.

24
00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:23.439
我想写出我能写的最好的代码，最清晰，最好的，
I want to be writing the best code that I can, the clearest, best,

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.480
良好的文档，易于理解，良好的代码，因为
well documented, easy to understand, good code because

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.270
我将与之合作的其他人将不得不接受该代码
other people who I'm gonna be working with are gonna have to take that code and

27
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.020
让它变得更好，我不想让他们失败，
make it better and I don't want to be setting them up for failure,

28
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.759
我不想让他们失望，我不想让他们的生活更糟，
I don't want to be frustrating them, I don't want to be making their lives worse,

29
00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.870
我想让他们的生活变得更好，我希望每个人都有好的代码
I want to make their lives better, I want good code for everybody and

30
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.469
我希望他们也能这样做，这样编程就可以
I expect them to do the same so programming can be

31
00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.049
一个人的活动，但通常我们试图做的事情，这是如此复杂。
a solo activity but generally we're trying to do stuff which is so complicated.

32
00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.810
我们试着这么快做。
We're trying to do it so quickly.

33
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.780
我们几乎每时每刻都在团队合作，有时甚至是大团队。
We're working in teams almost all the time and sometimes big teams.

34
00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:08.349
在大量的文学作品中，有一个想法就是用单一的声音写作。
And in large literary efforts, there's this idea of writing with a single voice.

35
00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.340
就像你在写一本百科全书，或者
Like if you're writing an encyclopedia, or

36
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.699
如果你有几个作家在写一本书，或者你在写一本杂志，或者
if your a couple of authors writing a book, or if you're writing a magazine, or

37
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.819
还有一件事，我们有很多作家在同一个项目上工作。
some other thing we've got lots of writers working on the same project.

38
00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.139
他们都试图用同样的声音写作。
They're all trying to write in the same voice.

39
00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.740
这不会干扰
And that doesn't interfere at

40
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.170
所有这些都需要能够表达好的想法并清楚地表达出来。
all with being able to express good ideas and presenting it clearly.

41
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.180
我认为我们也需要在编写软件时做到这一点，所以
And I think we need to be doing that in writing software too, so

42
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.189
我希望我们都用同样的声音写作
I want us to be writing all in the same voice and

43
00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.039
这个声音是有史以来最聪明、最专业的程序员。
that voice is the smartest most professional programmer who's ever lived.

44
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.240
我希望团队中的每个人都能写到那个水平。
I want everybody on the team to be writing up to that level.

45
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.219
我不希望任何人因为他们认为他们需要
I don't want anybody dumbing it down because they think they need to

46
00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.030
通过省略分号来表达自己。
express themselves by leaving out the semicolons.

47
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.770
我希望每个人都写得很好。
I want everybody to be writing really well.

48
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.300
然后是第三个，管理。
Then number three, Management.

49
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.659
如果他们要求，而且有意义，好的，我们也会这样做。
If they ask for it and it makes sense, okay we'll do that too.

50
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.659
现在一些经理可能会说，哇，这一分钟，我们应该在
Now some managers might be saying, woh, what a minute, we're supposed to be in

51
00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.050
在这里充电，难道我们不应该是第一名吗？我不这么认为。
charge here, shouldn't we be number one and I don't think so.

52
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.050
我认为三号是适合他们的地方。
I think number three is the right place for them.

53
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.990
如果你看看首席执行官做什么，他们最重要的职责之一
If you look at what a CEO does one of their most important responsibilities

54
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.680
就是帮助公司提高警惕。
is to help the company look out.

55
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.530
公司有一种趋势，特别是当他们变得更大的时候
There's a tendency in the company especially as they get bigger

56
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.329
一切都集中在里面。
that everything is focused inside.

57
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.939
有争夺资源、关注和晋升的竞争
There's competition for resources and attention and promotion and

58
00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.090
所有这些东西，你往往会忘记客户和
all of that stuff, and you tend to forget about the customer and

59
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.219
你可以忘记，你会倾向于忘记市场和所有这些
you can forget the and you tend to forget about the marketplace and all these really

60
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.189
实际上比内心发生的事情更重要的事情
things that are actually much more important than what's going on inside and

61
00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.229
CEO的部分职责是提醒公司这一点
part of the CEO's role is to remind the company of that and

62
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.819
你看首席执行官总是说要做客户，要以客户为中心
you see CEO's always saying things like be the customer and be customer focused and

63
00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.360
所有这些东西就是这一切的意义所在。
all that stuff that's what that's all about.

64
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.439
这与我所说的非常一致
And that's very compatible with what I'm what I'm saying and

65
00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.000
说第一，人民。
saying number one, The People.

66
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:05.930
那么公司最大的问题之一就是他们的
Then one of the biggest problems that companies have is that their

67
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.969
代码基是可怕的，它们充满了croft与调用遗产它是
code bases are awful, that they're full of croft there with the call legacy it's

68
00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:17.240
只是糟糕的东西，这严重损害了公司的竞争能力。
just awful stuff and that seriously impairs the company's ability to compete.

69
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.230
你不能改变，你不能扩展，你不能成长
That you can't make changes, you can't extend, you can't grow

70
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.389
因为软件质量差，所以阻碍了你的发展。
because the software is holding you back because of it's poor quality.

71
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.278
软件变成了负债而不是资产。
The software becomes a liability rather than an asset.

72
00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.096
我认为我们可以改变这一点，如果我们正在编写高质量的软件
And I think we can change that if we're writing high quality of software for

73
00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:38.709
团队，我们让公司变得更有竞争力，
the team, that we allow the company then to be much more competitive,

74
00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:41.620
更具响应性，更好地服务于市场。
much more responsive, much better to serve the market.

75
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.574
假设您正在编写自己的软件，
Suppose you're writing your own software,

76
00:04:45.574 --> 00:04:50.189
你的家，你在做你自己的事情，那么你的责任是什么？
your home and you're doing your own stuff, what are your responsibilities then?

77
00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.519
头号人物仍然是人们，假设其他人将不得不
Number one still The People, assuming that someone else is ever gonna have to

78
00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.649
写你的东西你真的应该为他们写好无论他们是谁，
write your stuff you really should write it well for them whoever they might be,

79
00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:04.968
即使你不知道他们会是谁，当你知道他们会是谁的时候，心里还是应该有一个人
even if you don't know who they're gonna be should still have somebody in mind when

80
00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:06.533
你在写这些东西。
you're writing this stuff.

81
00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:10.399
然后是球队的第二名，如果你有任何野心的话
And then number two The Team, if you have any ambition of

82
00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:15.257
这个东西变得足够好，你可能会想要开放它的源代码
this stuff getting good enough that you might wanna open source it that

83
00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:19.891
意味着您的团队现在可能是世界上的每个程序员。
means your team is now potentially every programmer in the world.

84
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:21.500
所以让它对他们有好处。
So make it good for them.

85
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.060
然后第三位是你的管理层所以请自便。
And then number three your management so knock yourself out.

86
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:30.000
这就是我们的结局。
That brings us to the end.

87
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.250
我想不出还有什么可以告诉你的。
I can't think of anything else to tell you.

88
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.800
所以，非常感谢大家。
So, thank you all very much.

89
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.000
但在我们走之前，我有一个建议。
But before we go, I've got one piece of advice.

90
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.829
这真的很严重，我希望你不要忘记这一点。
This is really serious, I hope you don't forget this.

91
00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:42.329
这是，我现在是认真的。
This is, I'm really serious now.

92
00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:45.629
请不要制造虫子。
Please, don't make bugs.

93
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.231
&gt；&gt；扬声器2：[笑]&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：谢谢。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Douglas: Thank you.

94
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:53.019
&gt；&gt；[掌声]&gt；&gt；扬声器2：我们已经
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE] &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We've

95
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.069
查德随机问了几个问题。
got a couple random questions from Chad.

96
00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.927
我不确定你是否还想回答更多的问题。
I'm not sure if you want to take any more questions but.

97
00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:01.629
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：它们好吗？
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Are they good?

98
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.790
&GT；&GT；演讲者2：嗯，这只是一种关于SWIFT的意见，意见。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well it's just kind of opinions, opinions on Swift.

99
00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:10.437
我对斯威夫特没有意见。
I don't have an opinion on Swift.

100
00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:15.396
[相声]&gt；&gt；演讲者3：你的意见如何
[CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How about your opinion

101
00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:16.079
打字稿？
on typescript?

102
00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.122
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：在打字稿上，我认为打字稿是一个陷阱，它把你困在里面
&gt;&gt; Douglas: On typescript, I see typescript as a trap, it keeps you in

103
00:06:20.122 --> 00:06:26.410
一个经典的模型，如果你的函数被锁定在打字稿中，你永远也找不出函数。
a classical model, you'll never figure out functions if yours locked into typescript.

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:07.089
&gt；&gt；Douglas：這兩個系統RQ和JSCheck，
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Both of these systems RQ and JSCheck,

3
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.259
最大限度地利用閉合和繼續。
make tremendous use of closure and continuation.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.839
與閉合和延續一起工作的真正偉大之處在於
And the really great thing about working with closure and continuation

5
00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.629
當你注意到這一點時，它們會讓你覺得自己很聰明。
is that they make you feel really smart when you notice this right.

6
00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.736
昨天，你為結案做了很多工作，
Yesterday, that you've been doing a lot of work with closure,

7
00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:28.030
當你拿到這些東西的時候，你會覺得自己很聰明，就像，嗯。
it makes you feel smart when you get these things, it's like, mm.

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.207
所以，每個人都應該有這種感覺，但你知道，那些做了很多事情的人
So and everybody deserves to feel that way yet you know how people who do a lot of

9
00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:37.770
函數語言程式設計總是表現得像他們比你聰明得多？
functional programming are always acting like they're so much smarter than you are?

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.462
他們不是，但是他們一直在和這些東西打交道
They're not, but they're working with this stuff all the time and

11
00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.481
這會讓他們一直感覺很好。
it makes them feel good all the time.

12
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.719
這讓他們覺得自己很聰明，這真的是一種很好的感覺，
It makes them feel smart and that's a really good way to feel,

13
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.299
每個人都應該有這樣的感覺。
everybody should feel like that.

14
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.359
而你每天工作的東西會讓你覺得自己很聰明嗎？
Whereas the stuff you're working with every day, does it make you feel smart?

15
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.679
不不是的。
No it does not.

16
00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.229
所以你想要拿到這些東西，這很棒。
So you want to get a hold of this stuff, and it's great.

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.759
所以這兩個專案都是公共領域，都在GitHub上。
So both of these projects are public domain, they're both on GitHub.

18
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:06.709
他們都是完全免費的，如果他們能幫你去拿的話會有很多
They're both totally free, if they can help you go ahead and take it there's lots

19
00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.239
世界上其他的好東西，如果它更適合你的話，也可以用它。
of other good stuff in the world too if that is better suited to you use that.

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.239
那麼，還有關於RQ、JSCheck或同步性的最後問題嗎？
So any last questions about RQ or JSCheck or synchronicity?

21
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:17.209
是?
Yes?

22
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.390
&gt；&gt；演講者2：這裡有幾個人在排隊。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a couple that queued up here.

23
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.608
第一，他在想你是不是
One, he was wondering if you,

24
00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:26.656
因為型別推斷與Hasko相同，所以您簽出Elm了嗎？
have you checked out Elm since the type inference is the same as Hasko?

25
00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:29.719
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：是的，我之前提到過榆樹，有很多好東西。
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Yeah, I mentioned Elm earlier, there's good stuff.

26
00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.329
名單上的一切都很好，但我想你會對我們的佇列感興趣，
Everything in that list is good, but I think our queue is of interest to you,

27
00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.528
因為我認為它最適合您必須實施的工作流。
because it is the best suited, I think, to the workflows that you have to implement.

28
00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:51.439
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：還有別的嗎？
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Anything else?

29
00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.750
&gt；&gt；演講者2：有一個來自安全部門。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's one from earlier from the security section.

30
00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.359
他只是想讓你澄清，或者他在問，
He just wanted you to clarify, or he's asking,

31
00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:01.390
我們正在學習安全中的物體以及如何防止攻擊，但是
we're learning about objects in security and how to prevent attacks but

32
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.680
這不是伺服器應該處理的事情嗎？
isn't this something that servers are supposed to deal with?

33
00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.300
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：這是每件事都必須處理的事情，不是這樣的
&gt;&gt; Douglas: It's something everything has to deal with, it's not so

34
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
很多伺服器，都是我們。
much the servers, it's us.

35
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.810
我們要處理的是執行這些專案的人。
It's the people running the programs we have to deal with the stuff.

36
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.985
&gt；&gt；演講者3：是的，不過說得更具體一點。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, a little bit more specifically, though.

37
00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:26.223
聽起來我們在談論，你有一個物體
It sounds like we're talking about, you have an object and

38
00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:30.969
你不想讓其他物體攻擊它，這跟混搭有關，對吧？
you don't want some other object to attack it, this has to do with mash-ups, right?

39
00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.159
因為你想把你的程式碼借給別人
Because you want to lend out your code to somebody else and

40
00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.800
您需要確保它們不會感染您的程式碼。
you want to make sure that they don't infect your code.

41
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.810
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：我想加強一切，所以
&gt;&gt; Douglas: I want to strengthen everything, so

42
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.729
如果我可以使我的程式碼足夠強大，我可以與第三方一起執行它，
if I can make my code strong enough that I can run it with third parties,

43
00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.599
這就是我們希望混搭能夠做到的事情，
which is the thing that we want mash-ups to be able to do,

44
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.750
我可以確信，它也會與我的同事的東西一起工作，那就是
I can be confident that it's going to work with my coworkers stuff as well that That

45
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.300
大多數破壞我們系統的攻擊都是自己造成的。
most of the attacks that are bringing our systems down are self-inflicted right.

46
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.050
我們對自己做的事情，因為我們沒有讓它很好地工作。
The stuff that we do to ourselves because we just didn't get it working well.

47
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.689
&gt；&gt；演講者3：因為你不是說如果你不做混搭，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because you're not saying if you're not doing mash-ups,

48
00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.590
不用擔心這個嗎？
don't worry about this?

49
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.099
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：不，不，我們需要一直擔心這個問題。
&gt;&gt; Douglas: No, no we need to worry about this all the time.

50
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.060
我們寫的每一件事都應該達到這樣的質量水平，所有的東西，所有的東西。
Everything we write should be to that level of quality, everything, everything.

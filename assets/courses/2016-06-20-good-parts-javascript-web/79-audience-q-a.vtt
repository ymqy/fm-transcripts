2
00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:07.360
&gt；&gt；扬声器1：有一个关于能够冻结数据对象的问题。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There's a question about being able to freeze data objects.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.230
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：你可以，除非你有什么东西，否则我不推荐
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: You can, I don't recommend it unless you have something

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.460
真的想保持不变。
that really wants to be immutable.

5
00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.469
记住，一旦你冻结了一些东西，你就不能解冻它。
Remember that once you freeze something you can't unfreeze it.

6
00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:18.750
所以你只走一条路。
So you're only going one way.

7
00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.929
&gt；&gt；扬声器1：然后让我们看看，日期和JSON。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then let's see, Dates and JSON.

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.940
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：不，JSON完成了。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Nope, JSON's done.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.690
&gt；&gt；扬声器1：是的。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.100
不好吧。
Well, no okay.

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.899
所以你只是没有推荐的格式？
So you just don't have a recommended format?

12
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.840
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：JavaScript没有，所以JSON没有。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: JavaScript didn't have one so JSON didn't get one.

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.560
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：使用时间戳？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Use timestamp?

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.710
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：是的，我建议使用ISO字符串。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Yep, I'd recommend using ISO Strings.

15
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.369
这似乎是最聪明的事情。
That seems to be the smartest thing.

16
00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.659
我知道有很多人不喜欢做最聪明的事情，所以
I know there are lot of people who don't like doing smartest things, so

17
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:47.859
他们可以随心所欲。
they're free to do whatever they want.

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.549
&gt；&gt；Speaker 4：您对JSON[INAUDIBLE]规范有什么看法
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What's your take on the JSON [INAUDIBLE] spec that's been

19
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.250
最近到处走动吗？
going around recently?

20
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：对于Java？
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: For Java?

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.790
&gt；&gt；扬声器4：不，它是[INAUDIBLE]和
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: No, it's a [INAUDIBLE] and

22
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.629
这是一种为[INAUDIBLE]服务器格式化JSON admins的方式。
it's being kinda way to format JSON admins for [INAUDIBLE] server.

23
00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:09.602
算法内部如何组织数据的基本集合。
Basic collection of how you organize data inside the algorithm.

24
00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.780
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：我不知道。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I'm not aware of it.

25
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.109
任何人都可以自由地做任何他们想做的事。
Anybody is free to do anything they want.

26
00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.105
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：线程和错误。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thread and bugs.

27
00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:20.186
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：不，不幸的是，他们也可以自由这么做。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: No, unfortunately they're free to do that too.

28
00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:24.814
&gt；&gt；扬声器5：[笑]&gt；&gt；扬声器6：为什么你没有
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Why don't you have

29
00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:25.590
对斯威夫特的看法？
an opinion on Swift?

30
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.189
你只是看得不够吗，还是-&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：我
Have you just not looked at it enough, or- &gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I've

31
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.450
看得不够。
not looked at enough.

32
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.480
我去拿斯威夫特的报告
I went to get the Swift report and

33
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.689
它被隐藏在一些苹果登录的东西后面，并且说地狱。
it was hidden behind some Apple login thing and said hell with that.

34
00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:35.879
所以我没拿到。
So I didn't get it.

35
00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:38.620
所以我不了解最新情况。
So I'm not up to date on it.

36
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.067
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：你不用骆驼壳的原因是什么？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's the reason you don't use camel case.

37
00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.865
[听不见]
[INAUDIBLE].

38
00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.329
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所以有一个很大的争论，
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So there's this big debate,

39
00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.251
在任何语言中做多单词标识符的正确方法是什么？
what is the correct way to do multi-word identifiers in any language?

40
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.694
您是应该使用骆驼大小写还是应该使用under bar和
Should you use camel case or should you use under bars and

41
00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:57.763
这是另一个程序员不能达成一致的事情，
this is another one of those things that programmers can't agree on,

42
00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:00.219
你知道会有没完没了的争论。
that you know there's an endless argument.

43
00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.560
有一个无休止的争论为什么它永远不会结束，
And the reason there is an endless argument why it will never end,

44
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.109
是因为他们都错了。
is because they are both wrong.

45
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.819
正确的做法应该是使用空间，
That the correct thing should have been to use space,

46
00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.550
我们的语言只需要变得更聪明一点，我们可以有空格
that our languages only have to get a tiny bit smarter and we could have spaces as

47
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.960
名字中的有效字符，然后他们会读得更好
valid characters inside of names and then they would read better and

48
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.889
他们会更容易，处理和所有这些东西。
they'd be easier to, to, process and all of that stuff.

49
00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:27.650
所以除了获取数字之外，我在下一门语言中寻找的一个方面
So one of the aspects I'm looking for in the next language besides getting numbers

50
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.139
对，就是它也允许空格作为名字的组成部分。
right, is that it'll also allow space as a component of names.

51
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.520
&gt；&gt；扬声器7：那是角度还是角度2？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: That's in Angular or Angular 2?

52
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.189
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：很多角度或角度2。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Lots of angular or angular two.

53
00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.060
这是两个完全不同的问题。
That's two completely different question.

54
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.329
&gt；&gt；扬声器7：或者？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Either or?

55
00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.560
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：我看过棱角和
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I've looked at angular and

56
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.819
我有点惊讶于让事情变得容易是多么的困难。
I was kind of surprised at how hard it is to get to make something easy.

57
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.389
我不明白。
I don't get it.

58
00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.479
我从那些信誓旦旦的人那里听到的
I hear from people who swear by it and

59
00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:03.139
我认为这很棒，也许它解决了他们的问题。
I think that's great and maybe it solves the problem they have.

60
00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.120
我没有观察到这解决了我的问题。
I've not observed that solves a problem that I have.

61
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.330
&GT；&GT；演讲者8：这是斯德哥尔摩的事情，我认为是有棱角的，一旦你到了那里。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: It's the Stockholm thing, I think with angular, once you get there.

62
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.580
&gt；&gt；扬声器7：是的。这太棒了。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah. This is great.

63
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.430
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所有这些框架的问题是
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Well the problem with all these frameworks is that

64
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.539
一旦你得到承诺，你就被困住了。
once you get committed you are stuck.

65
00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.939
你不能去，那是个错误，退后。
You can't go, that was mistake and back off.

66
00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.569
你完全投入了
You're fully committed and

67
00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.789
所以，在你做出承诺之前，你无法发现这些事情中的任何一件是好还是不好。
so, you can't find out if any of these things are good or not until you commit.

68
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.699
所以你必须小心。
And so you have to be careful.

69
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.632
&gt；&gt；演讲者3：所以我从Github到Douglas Crawford.com和
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So I went from Github to Douglas Crawford dot com and

70
00:03:32.632 --> 00:03:34.831
你显然没有低CSS。
you clearly have no low CSS.

71
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:39.420
[笑]那里没有CSS
[LAUGH] There's no CSS on there.

72
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.159
[听不见]什么？
[INAUDIBLE] What?

73
00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.650
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：什么？
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: What?

74
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.139
&GT；&GT；演讲者3：你对C.S.有什么问题？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's your issue with C.S.S.?

75
00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.000
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：你会再次提起那个旧伤口吗？
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Are you going to bring up that old wound again?

76
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.453
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：先生，是的&gt；&gt；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：所以C.S.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sir I, Yeah &gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So C.S.S.

77
00:03:52.453 --> 00:04:00.159
是为格式化技术文档而设计的，这是它生活中的目的。
was designed for formatting technical documents that was its purpose in life.

78
00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.699
这不是我们使用它的形式，我们将它用于各种非常
And that is not what we use it form, we use it for all kinds of stuff that is very

79
00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.129
非常适合，我们使用它是因为它是唯一的选择。
badly suited for and we use it because it's the only option.

80
00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.840
而且它比它出现之前要好，因为在过去没有
And it's better than it was before it came along because in the past there were no

81
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.161
过去人们通过使用微小的小尺寸来进行排版间距的选项
options used to see people doing typographic spacing by having tiny little

82
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.519
其中有一点点空白
that with a little bit of white space in them which

83
00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:28.069
被认为是当天的最佳实践，但总是一件可怕的事情。
was considered a best practice on the day but was always a terrible thing to do.

84
00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:34.569
所以，相比CSS是伟大的，但与我们应得的相比，它是可怕的。
So, compared to that CSS is great but compared to what we deserve it's awful.

85
00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.009
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：你仍然可以使用一些HTML，对吧，我的意思是-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You can still use some HTML, right, I mean-

86
00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.947
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：是的，那也是。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Yeah That too.

87
00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:43.906
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：[笑]&gt；&gt；扬声器9：任何意见
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Any opinions

88
00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.240
关于生锈的语言？
on the rust language?

89
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.509
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：不，我没有，我读过他们的一些材料。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: No, I don't, I have read some of their material.

90
00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.680
它没有被锁在苹果密码后面，所以我读了一些
It wasn't locked behind an Apple password so I have read some of that and

91
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.819
其中一些看起来很有希望，但我还没有得出任何结论。
some of it looks promising but I don't have any conclusions yet.

92
00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:00.596
我没有和它合作过。
I've not worked with it.

93
00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:03.490
&gt；&gt；演讲者1：趋势，桩和，我的意思是，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What about trends, pilers and, I mean,

94
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.237
你有什么建议或者-&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：那么
do you have any recommendations or- &gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So

95
00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:11.389
让我说一下CoffeeScript，它引发了这股热潮。
let me say this about CoffeeScript, which started this craze.

96
00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.629
我非常喜欢CoffeeScript。
I like CoffeeScript a lot.

97
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:19.059
CoffeeScript使JavaScript的一些好的部分更加明显。
CoffeeScript makes some of the good parts of JavaScript more visible.

98
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.519
对于一些人来说，如果他们学会了，学习如何很好地使用JavaScript会更容易
For some people it's easier to learn how to use JavaScript well if they learn

99
00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.430
咖啡脚本也是。
CoffeeScript also.

100
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.819
我认为我最喜欢CoffeeScript的一点是
I think the thing I like best about CoffeeScript

101
00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.069
它看起来不像C，或者Java，或者任何其他语言。
is that it doesn't look like C, or Java, or any of those other languages.

102
00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.810
它有自己的外观。
It's got its own look.

103
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.350
过去人们常说，任何新的编程语言都不可能成功，除非它
It used to be said that no new programming language could succeed unless it

104
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.920
看起来像C.
looked like C.

105
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.579
in CoffeeScript表明这不再是真的
In CoffeeScript is showing that that's no longer true

106
00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:46.509
CoffeeScript之所以成功，是因为它看起来不像C。
CoffeeScript succeeds because it doesn't look like C.

107
00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:47.590
所以，我非常喜欢。
So, I like that a lot.

108
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.449
那么问题是，你应该在生产中使用CoffeeScript吗？
Then the question is, should you use CoffeeScript in production?

109
00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:52.319
绝对不行。
Absolutely not.

110
00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.060
不，您不应该在生产中使用CoffeeScript。
No, you should not use CoffeeScript in production.

111
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.129
它仍然是一种实验性的语言，它增加了很多奇怪的东西。
It's still an experimental language it adds a lot of weirdness.

112
00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.060
这使得招聘人员变得更加困难，因为
It makes it harder to recruit people because

113
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.149
谁来写一些潮人留下的CoffeeScript东西。
who's gonna write the CoffeeScript stuff that some hipster left.

114
00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.540
只是不值得。
It's just not worth it.

115
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.870
所以，我总是建议学习这门语言。
So, I always recommend learn the language.

116
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.850
学习一门新的语言
Pick up a new language and

117
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.310
有些拼写的语言很有趣，值得学习。
some of the transpiled languages are interesting, and are worth to study.

118
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.110
但我不建议在生产中使用它们中的任何一个。
But I don't recommend using any of them in production.

119
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.350
我认为，他们没有增加足够的价值来证明这种怪异。
I think, they don't add enough value to justify the weirdness.

120
00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.290
&gt；&gt；演讲者8：非常感谢，并且
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Lots of thank yous, and

121
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.086
请表达他们对培训的感激之情。
please extend their gratitude for the training.

122
00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:44.100
你找到了吗-&gt；&gt；扬声器1：是的，有人问
Do you find anymore- &gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yes, somebody asking

123
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.855
有没有什么原因让你禁用了关于你的Get Up项目的bug报告。
is there a reason that you disabled bug reports on your get up projects.

124
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:53.720
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：我没有那样做。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I didn't do that.

125
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.600
什么，我抱怨起来没有
What, I have complained to get up that there is no

126
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.899
我试着用正确的方式来表达，我倾向于吸引巨魔。
I'm trying to think of it the right way to say this, I tend to attract trolls.

127
00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:09.689
我不知道为什么，但是
I don't know why this is, but

128
00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:13.490
有很多人真的很想来我现在的地方
there are a lot of people who really want to come on to where I am and

129
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.459
做一些粗鲁的行为，这不仅令人讨厌，而且是浪费时间。
do trollish behavior, which is more than annoying, it's a waste of time.

130
00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:24.660
我必须处理巡逻，我不喜欢这样做。
I have to deal with the patrols and I don't like having to do that.

131
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.810
所以我要求Git Hub提供一个没有巨魔的选项。
So I've asked Git Hub for a no troll option.

132
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.170
到目前为止，他们还没有想出如何实现这一点。
And so far they have not figured out how to implement that.

133
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.615
所以有些事情我已经关闭了，但并没有完全关闭，
So there are some things that I've turned things off but it's not completely off,

134
00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:38.654
你还是可以给我留言的。
you can still get messages to me.

135
00:07:38.654 --> 00:07:43.254
但如果你曾经骚扰过我，我会把你放在封锁名单上，所以这可能是他的担忧。
But if you have trolled me, I put you on the block list so that may be his concern.

136
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.980
他过去可能曾经骗过我，但现在他不能骗我了。
He may have trolled me in the past but he can't troll me now.

137
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:54.903
[笑]所以我不会为此道歉
[LAUGH] So I'm not gonna apologize for that.

138
00:07:54.903 --> 00:07:58.100
&gt；&gt；演讲者1：你对构建系统有什么看法吗？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Did you have any opinions on build systems?

139
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.209
你提到了连接的做法，以及所有这些东西。
You mentioned practices of concatenating, and all that stuff.

140
00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:09.779
他们在说网络包之类的东西。
They're saying things like web pack or whatever.

141
00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.220
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：不，我不在乎，只要管用就行。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: No, I don't care, whatever works.

142
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.839
&gt；&gt；扬声器1：是的，我就是这么想的。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I figured.

143
00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:18.865
看不到任何其他问题。
Not seeing any other questions.

144
00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:24.930
房间里有人吗？
Anybody in the room?

145
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:31.660
你最后一次得到意见的机会[笑]好吧。
Your last chance to get an opinion [LAUGH] all right.

146
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.647
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：我想我们被判了死刑。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I think we're adjurned.

147
00:08:32.647 --> 00:08:33.720
&gt；&gt；演讲者1：结束，对。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Concluded, right.

148
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.220
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：谢谢。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Thank you.

2
00:00:04.128 --> 00:00:07.482
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所以最后两个练习是对
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So those last two exercises are the introduction to

3
00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.839
安全的主题。
the subject of security.

4
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.650
安全是一个非常重要的话题，而且
And security is a really, really important topic, and

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.550
不幸的是，在我们行业的任何层面上都没有得到很好的理解。
unfortunately it's not well understood at any level in our industry.

6
00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:27.140
因此，有些人认为安全是戴着看不见的彩色帽子的人之间的战争。
So, some people think of security as a war between people in invisible colored hats.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.199
他们是白帽子的家伙和黑帽子的家伙，而且
They're the white hat guys and the black hat guys, and

8
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.359
白帽子的人可能是好人，黑帽子的人可能是坏人，
the white hat guys are probably good guys and black hat guys are probably bad guys,

9
00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.090
除了有著名的白帽，以前是黑帽，还有黑帽
except there are famous white hats that used to be black hats, and black hats

10
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.229
曾经是白帽和灰帽的人似乎是两面派。
who used to be white hats and grey hats who seem to be playing both sides.

11
00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.630
事实证明，你不能很容易地通过看不见的帽子来识别一个人。
And it turns out you cannot easily identify somebody by their invisible hat.

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.939
这是一种不起作用的安全模式。
That this is a model of security that just doesn't work.

13
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.036
安全不是帽子的问题。
Security is not about hats.

14
00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.421
更糟糕的是这个模型
The thing that's even worse about that model is that it

15
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:06.040
说安全属于专家，这种模式不起作用。
says that security belongs to the specialists, and that model doesn't work.

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.989
所以在专家模型中，这意味着您有负责的安全专家
So in the specialist model it means you've got security experts who are responsible

17
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:13.150
所有的安全，没有其他人对安全负责。
for all the security and nobody else is responsible for security.

18
00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:19.170
事实上，其他所有人都在与那些帮助我们的人作对
And in fact everybody else is working against the guys who are helping to

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.900
处理安全问题，这种模式根本就不有效。
deal with security and that model is not effective at all.

20
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.420
不安全感的一个后果或一个来源就是事情发生了变化。
One consequence of, or one source of insecurity is that things change.

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.210
可能是在有限的范围内或有限的上下文中，您可以做一些事情
It might be that within a limited scope or a limited context you could do things and

22
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.520
这样做没有安全漏洞。
there's no security vulnerability in doing that.

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.759
但是后来，事情发生了变化，范围扩大了，或者其他什么。
But then, things change, the scope increases, or whatever.

24
00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.379
而现在这突然变成了一个很大的安全问题。
And now suddenly that turns into a big security problem.

25
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.740
对于目的或用途来说，这并不是不寻常的，或者
It is not unusual for the purpose or use or

26
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.120
要在其生命周期内更改的软件范围。
scope of software to change over its life.

27
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.039
很少在上下文中重新检查软件系统的安全属性
Rarely are the security properties of software systems reexamined in the context

28
00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.129
新的或不断发展的任务。
of new or evolving missions.

29
00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.680
这会导致系统不安全。
This leads to insecure systems.

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.640
你知道这是谁写的吗？
You know who wrote this?

31
00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.811
是我写的那就是我。
I did, I wrote that, that's me.

32
00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:11.280
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所以我将给你们一套原则。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So I'm going to be giving you a set of principles.

33
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.789
其中大部分都很简单，很明显，一旦你有了它，
And most of them are pretty simple and pretty obvious and once you've got it,

34
00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:21.840
你可以自己对安全问题进行推理。
you're able to reason about security on your own.

35
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.490
安全世界是令人难以置信的复杂，而且
The world of security is incredibly complicated, and

36
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.045
总是在变化，任何人都不可能掌握它，
is always changing, and it's impossible for any human to keep on top of it,

37
00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:34.979
尤其是一个有白天工作的人，根本没有办法。
particularly a human who has a day job, there's just no way.

38
00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.224
但这套原则实际上很小，如果你能理解
But the set of principles is actually very small and if you can understand

39
00:02:39.224 --> 00:02:44.704
原则，你可以自己解决剩下的大部分问题。
the principles, you can work out most of the rest of it on your own.

40
00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:47.914
安全性不是通过诡计或黑客获得的，
Security is not obtained by tricks or hacks,

41
00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:53.435
如果你遇到有人说，我们可以通过做这个把戏来保护我们的系统，
if you ever encounter someone who says, we can secure our system by doing this trick,

42
00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.840
那个人不是被误导就是在撒谎。
that person is either misinformed or lying.

43
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.722
因为事实证明花招是行不通的，
Because it turns out tricks don't work,

44
00:02:57.722 --> 00:02:59.933
只有坚持原则才能奏效。
it's only adherence to principles that works.

45
00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.530
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所以首要原则之一是
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So one of the first principles for

46
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.356
计算机系统的在线安全是威慑不是有效的，
online security of computer systems is that deterrence is not effective,

47
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:15.050
那是因为你不能惩罚一个看不见的攻击者。
and that's because you can't punish an invisible attacker.

48
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.680
现在现实世界中，威慑是非常有效的。
Now in the real world, deterrence is very effective.

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.509
这就是为什么我们还没有把自己炸飞。
That's why we have not blown ourselves up yet.

50
00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.150
但是在网上，攻击者在攻击你的时候不需要醒着
But online an attacker doesn't need to be awake while he's attacking you so

51
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.417
你不能对看不见或看不见的人构成威胁
there's no threat you can make to someone you can't see or

52
00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.768
触摸以阻止他们做事情。
touch to prevent them from doing things.

53
00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:33.127
所以唯一有效的就是预防，
So the only thing that works is prevention,

54
00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:35.629
预防是唯一有效的机制。
prevention is the only effective mechanism.

55
00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.129
所以我要在这里停下来给你们讲一个关于约翰·马丁·施莱尔的故事。
So I'm gonna stop here and tell you a story about Johann Martin Schleyer.

56
00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.320
施莱尔是巴伐利亚的一名牧师
Schleyer was a priest living in Bavaria and

57
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.026
一天晚上，上帝在梦中来到他身边，告诉他做点什么。
one night God came to him in a dream and told him to do something.

58
00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:53.189
现在，为了理解这个故事，我需要告诉你们一个更早的故事。
Now in order to understand that story I need to tell you an earlier story.

59
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.680
很久以前，在希纳平原上，世界上最好的建筑师，
Long, long ago on the plain of Shinar, the world's best architects,

60
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.080
建造者、工程师、材料专家和
builders, engineers, material specialists, and

61
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.310
工人们聚集在一起建造了一座通向天堂的塔。
workers got together to build a tower that would reach to heaven.

62
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.949
这是当时世界历史上最大的建筑项目。
It was the biggest construction project in the history of the world at that point.

63
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.850
这是一个令人惊异的项目，上帝对此并不高兴。
It was amazing project and God was not happy about it.

64
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.528
我们不知道他对这个项目的抱怨是什么
We don't know what his complaint about the project was but

65
00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:25.194
他不想让它成功，所以他决定让这个项目失败。
he did not want it succeeding, so he decided to cause the project to fail.

66
00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:29.492
对于如何让项目失败，他有很多选择。
And he had a lot of options available as to how he was going to fail the project.

67
00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:32.576
他可能会引起地震，他可能会淹没飞机，
He could have caused earthquakes, he could have flooded the plane,

68
00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:35.680
他本可以把雷电扔在他们身上。
he could have thrown thunderbolts down on them.

69
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.346
相反，他决定下去混淆他们的讲话。
Instead he decided to go down and confuse their speech.

70
00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:45.257
在他这样做之后，他们说话的时候就不能再互相理解了，
And after he did that they could no longer understand each other when they spoke,

71
00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:48.944
无法沟通项目崩溃，以及
and being unable to communicate the project collapsed, and

72
00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:52.358
他们都迷失了方向，建立了自己的国家。
they all wandered off and started their own countries.

73
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.266
基本上是他制造了i18n问题。
Basically he created the i18n problem.

74
00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.781
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：所以几千年后他来到施莱耶
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So thousands of years later he comes to Schleyer while

75
00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:07.980
他睡着了，说，我改变主意了，我想要什么
he's sleeping and says, I've changed my mind about that, and what I want

76
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.529
你现在要做的就是创造一种世界上每个人都能理解的语言。
you to do now is to create a language that everybody in the world can understand.

77
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.939
所以Schleyer醒了，他开始学习他的语言，他称之为Volapuk。
So Schleyer wakes up and he begins working on his language, which he calls Volapuk.

78
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.250
Volapuk是Volapuk中的单词，意思是世界说话。
Volapuk being the word in Volapuk, meaning world speak.

79
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.790
他的词汇量是以英语为基础的，但是
He based his vocabulary on English, but

80
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.840
他把它改造得如此之大，以至于对说英语的人来说一点帮助都没有。
he transformed it so much that it is no help to English speakers at all.

81
00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.629
很难看到里面的文字世界和演讲，
It's hard to see the words world and speech in there,

82
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.610
但这就是根的来源。
but that's where the roots came from.

83
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.707
他被告知说英语的人对变音没有问题。
And he was told that English speakers did not have a problem with umlauts.

84
00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:50.951
但我可以告诉你，这个说英语的人在变音方面有很多麻烦。
But I can tell you this English speaker has a lot of trouble with umlauts.

85
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.942
但他还是出版了他的语言。
But he published his language anyway.

86
00:05:52.942 --> 00:05:56.019
他工作了大约一年，然后
He worked for about a year and then and

87
00:05:56.019 --> 00:06:00.593
1880年用德语出版了一本关于Volapuk的书。
published a book in German about Volapuk in 1880.

88
00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:05.934
现在人们在Schleyer之前已经设计人工语言很多年了。
Now people had been designing artificial languages for many years before Schleyer.

89
00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:10.954
英国的约翰·威尔金斯和保罗·加诺也在做类似的事情
There was John Wilkins and Paul Garneau in England were doing similar

90
00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:16.151
各种各样的东西，而且在之后出现了很多人工语言
sorts of things, and there been lots of artificial languages after but

91
00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:19.629
施莱尔在正确的时间做了这件事。
Schleyer was doing this at just the right time.

92
00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.305
几个世纪以来，欧洲一直处于相当稳定的战争状态，
Europe had been in a fairly constant state of war for centuries and

93
00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:26.432
人们真的对此感到厌倦了。
people were getting really tired of it.

94
00:06:26.432 --> 00:06:29.978
他们观察了刚刚在美国发生的内战，
And they observed what had just happened in the U.S with their civil war,

95
00:06:29.978 --> 00:06:33.752
新技术第一次出现在战场上
where new technologies were coming onto the battlefield for the first time and

96
00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:36.930
那里发生的可怕的破坏。
the terrible devastation that happened there.

97
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.300
他们非常担心这会变得非常糟糕
And they were very concerned that this was going to get really, really bad and

98
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.129
人们对解决世界和平问题非常感兴趣。
there was a lot of interest in trying to solve the world peace problem.

99
00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.909
他们中的很多人都认为Volapuk是实现这一目标的一种方法。
And a lot of them saw Volapuk as a method for doing that.

100
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.879
Volapuk将允许我们经历去盲目化，
That Volapuk would allow us to experience de-babelization,

101
00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:01.519
我们将打破国与国之间的语言障碍，也许如果
where we would break down the language barriers between countries and maybe if

102
00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:05.540
我们可以更有效地沟通，也许即将到来的战争可以避免。
we can communicate more effectively, maybe the coming war could be avoided.

103
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:11.069
因此，Volapuk运动在世界各地开始兴起，不仅仅是欧洲，而是
And so the Volapuk movement took off all over the world, not just Europe but

104
00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:11.649
到处都是。
everywhere.

105
00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:15.850
在世界各地的城市中，正在创建沃尔拉普克社会。
In cities all over the world Volapuk societies were being created.

106
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.600
关于和在Volapuk出版的书籍。
Books were being published about and in Volapuk.

107
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.266
新的期刊正在用Volapuk写，每个月都会上线，
New journals were being written in Volapuk, coming online every month,

108
00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:27.629
它影响到了社会的各个阶层。
and it was reaching all classes of society.

109
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.129
学习这些东西的不仅仅是智力精英。
It wasn't just the intellectual elites learning this stuff.

110
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:35.389
每个人都对Volapuk感兴趣，它真的开始起飞了。
Everybody was interested in Volapuk and it was really taking off.

111
00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:37.995
这门语言的成功在很大程度上要归功于这个家伙。
And a lot of the success of the language was due to this guy.

112
00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:40.100
这是Auguste Kerckhoff
This is Auguste Kerckhoffs.

113
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.620
他是一位荷兰语言学家，他写了大量关于Volapuk和
He was a Dutch linguist, and he wrote extensively about Volapuk and

114
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.680
在世界各地传授语言。
traveled all over the world teaching the language.

115
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.725
他成功地做到了这一点，但在第二次沃拉普克会议上，
And he was so successful at doing that but at the Second Volapuk Conference,

116
00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:57.774
他被选为Volapuk研究所所长，并且
he was elected to be director of the Volapuk Institute, and

117
00:07:57.774 --> 00:08:01.384
考虑到在全世界推广Volapuk的工作。
given the job of popularizing Volapuk throughout the world.

118
00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:05.485
第二年在第三次大会上，
The next year at the Third Congress,

119
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:10.827
在那次大会上，他们做了沃尔帕克国会的所有事务，
at that Congress they did all of the business in the Congress in Volapuk,

120
00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:15.206
就连招待饭菜的服务员也在说沃拉普克，
even the waiters serving the meals were speaking Volapuk,

121
00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:20.129
Kerckhoff在那次会议上提出了对语言的修改。
and Kerckhoffs at that meeting proposed a change to the language.

122
00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:24.757
语言中有一些很少使用的情绪，非常
There were some moods in the language which were rarely used, that were very

123
00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:29.606
复杂和困难的教和学，Kerckhoff提出
complicated and difficult to teach and learn and Kerckhoffs was proposing that

124
00:08:29.606 --> 00:08:35.210
它们被从语言中删除，以便让每个人都能更容易地使用它。
they be removed from the language in order to make it more accessible to everybody.

125
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.700
基本上是Volapuk，好的部分。
Basically Volapuk, the good parts.

126
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.009
我爱这家伙。
I love this guy.

127
00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:40.620
他很棒。
He was great.

128
00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.769
施莱尔对此非常沮丧。
Schleyer was extremely upset about this.

129
00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:48.905
施莱耶坚持认为这门语言属于他
Schleyer insisted that the language belonged to him and

130
00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:53.840
他要求否决国会可能提出的任何建议。

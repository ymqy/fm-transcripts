00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:02.196
>> Jem Young: 确保软件安全的一种方法，或者
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So one way of
keeping your software secure, or

2
00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:05.205
确保您的电脑安全，防止这一天的发生。
keeping your computer secure,
is preventing these zero days.

3
00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.983
因此，当一个漏洞发生时，您希望使您的软件保持最新状态。
So the minute an exploit comes out,
you want to keep your software up to date.

4
00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:12.737
我们可以用一个叫做 " 无人照管升级" 的项目来完成这个过程。
And we can do this with a program
called Unattended Upgrades.

5
00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:17.564
它所做的是自动升级软件以进行安全性或次要修订。
What it does is it automatically upgrades
your software for security or minor fixes.

6
00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:19.757
现在让我们把它安装在我们的电脑上。
So let's go ahead and
install that now on our computer.

7
00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:22.222
那就这样吧
So sudo.

8
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.455
适当安装无人照管升级。
apt install unattended-upgrades.

9
00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:46.503
>> Jem Young: 执行
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Do that

10
00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:54.286
在这里
here.

11
00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:56.737
一般的 Ubuntu 分发版
And generally with modern
Ubuntu distributions,

12
00:00:56.737 --> 00:00:59.936
已经安装了因为他们想帮你
it's already installed because
they're trying to help you out.

13
00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:04.230
每个版本的 Ubuntu 变得更好，更方便用户。
Every version of Ubuntu gets a little bit
better, a little bit more user friendly.

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.010
让我们看看 conf 文件吧
And let's just check on the conf file.

15
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.277
我们今天不会修改它，但很高兴知道这些 conf 文件存在。
We're not gonna modify it today, but it's
good to know that these conf files exist.

16
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:13.804
所以我要少说
So I'm gonna say less,

17
00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:21.703
>> Jem Young: /etc/ apt， apt.conf.d 和
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: /etc/ apt, apt.conf.d, and

18
00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:27.088
我们将进行 50 个无人值守的升级
we'll go with 50 unattended upgrades.

19
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.938
>> Jem Young: 对于 etc/APT/APT.conf./unattendeupgradand
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: For an
etc/APT/APT.conf.d/unattendedupgrades and

20
00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:46.365
这些只是程序的配置文件，对于
these are just configuration files for
the programs, for

21
00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:51.254
应用程序及其在后台运行的特定实例。
apps and in this particular
instance it runs in the background.

22
00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:54.676
所以它所做的就是因为他们的所有东西都被注释掉了
So what it does is because most of
their everything's commented out,

23
00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:55.953
除了保安外
other than the security.

24
00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:59.020
分布在主要分布上
And distribution for
the main distribution,

25
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.224
这通常不会发生
which usually doesn't happen.

26
00:02:01.224 --> 00:02:04.596
通常不会对 LTS 版本进行重大的推送。
There's not usually a major
push on LTS version.

27
00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:08.141
我不知道 ESM 是什么但我觉得还行
And I don't know what ESM is,
but I think it's okay.

28
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:10.031
但我们最想要的就是安全升级。
But the main one we want
is the security upgrades.

29
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.450
所以每次在 Ubuntu 发现一个漏洞和漏洞
So every time there's a bug and
exploit discovered in Ubuntu,

30
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.593
您的计算机会自动为您进行最新的更改。
your computer is automatically going
to pull in the latest changes for you.

31
00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:19.052
这是很有帮助的。
This is really helpful.

32
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:22.436
当我第一次开始的时候，这并不存在。
When I first started out,
this didn't really exist.

33
00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:26.550
因此我必须运行一个定时作业，它是一个每天运行的作业，或者
So I had to run a cron job which is
a job that runs on a daily cycle or

34
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.445
不管我建立了什么东西都能自动安装这些东西
whatever I established it to be and
automatically install these things but

35
00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:34.574
没有意外的升级它会为你带来的
with unintended upgrades,
it does it for you.

36
00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:38.754
那就是，这只是一个非常好的特征，如果它是
And that's, that's just a a really nice
feature that we should all enable if it's

37
00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:40.618
尚未在系统中启用。
not already enabled in your system.

38
00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:43.760
始终确保您的系统具有保持最新的方式。
Always make sure your system has
a way of staying up to date.

39
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.998
Windows Update ，我想 Windows 10，他们那天放了零一天，
Windows Update, I think Windows 10,
they had a zero day release the other day,

40
00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:50.526
是从视频或者类似的东西
it was from a video drive or
something like that.

41
00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:54.218
因此，如果您可以，请始终使您的软件保持最新状态。
So again, always keep your
software up to date if you can.

42
00:02:54.218 --> 00:02:56.872
但不一定要跳最新版本的东西。
But don't necessarily jump on
the latest version of something.

43
00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:59.914
但是请保持最新的补丁和修订。
But stay on the latest patches and fixes.

44
00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:00.634
嗯。
Yes.

45
00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:04.250
>> 演讲者 2: 因此，一旦您运行此安装程序，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So to clarify,
once you run this installer,

46
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.961
这将会是自动驾驶的自动驾驶
that's going to essentially be
an autopilot and it will automatically

47
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:14.044
删除自动安装程序或自动升级程序 >> Jem Young: 是。
delete auto installer or auto upgrader
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

48
00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:17.393
>> 演讲者 2: 这个时间表的频率是多少 ?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
what's the frequency of that schedule?

49
00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:20.336
> > Jem Young: 我不知道，我觉得它可能每天都在检查。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I don't know,
I think it checks probably daily.

50
00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:24.106
只是检查一下附买回来说这事有什么最新进展吗
It just checks the apt repo and
says is there an update to this?

51
00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:25.975
如果是，请将其拉出并安装。
If so, pull it in and install it.

52
00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:29.961
>> 扬声器 2: 因此，理论上，您仍然容易受到零天的影响。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So theoretically you
would still be vulnerable to zero days.

53
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:30.923
>> Jem Young: 是。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

54
00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.268
所以他们被称为零日
Which is why they're called a zero day.

55
00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:34.449
如果他们被称为一天
If they were called a one day,

56
00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.389
足够给你足够的时间来解决这个问题
that would be enough to give
you enough time to fix it.

57
00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.711
如果是零，你的系统在运行，那么还没拍
If it's a zero day and your system is
running, then it's not patched yet

58
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:44.283
因为制造商根本就不知道
because the manufacturer
doesn't even know about it.

59
00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:46.800
因此它的零部分。
Hence the zero part of it.

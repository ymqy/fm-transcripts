1
00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.440
>> Jem Young: 但互联网以信任为基础。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But
the Internet runs on trust.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.289
这是一个很奇怪的概念，作为人类，
And it's a really weird concept that,
collectively as humanity,

3
00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.939
我们在政治和战争上存在分岐
we have our disagreements on politics and
war and

4
00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:16.190
是最棒的，但是我们大家都说，哎，
the best type of burrito, but
we all collectively said, hey,

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.550
让我们商定一套标准，让我的电脑可以跟你的电脑说话。
let's agree on a set of standards that
my computer can talk to your computer.

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.760
这在人类的过程中是非常重要的。
And this is a really big deal
in the course of mankind.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300
而且我不是说网上最伟大的发明
And, no, I'm not saying the Internet's
the greatest invention in the course

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.850
人类的世界
of mankind.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.760
但事实上我们可以有这些不同的想法
But the fact that we can have
these disparate ideas about

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.950
软件工程应该如何运作，编程语言最好
how software engineering should work,
what's the best programming language,

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.670
最好的操作系统是什么但我们都同意这一套标准
what's the best operating system, but
we all agree on this set of standards and

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.527
我们可以相互交流的协议是不可思议的
protocols that we can talk to
each other I think is incredible.

13
00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:45.090
我觉得我们的合作是把我们从动物中分离出来的
I think our cooperation is one of
the things that separates us from animals,

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.899
就像动物不能集体合作到我们可以
like animals can't collectively
cooperate to the level that we can, and

15
00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.049
这反映在互联网上
that's reflected in the Internet.

16
00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.560
你能告诉我对我的工作充满激情吗
Can you tell I'm passionate
about what I do?

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.939
我所说的是人类和社会科学以及所有这些东西。
That I'm talking about humanity and
social sciences and all that things.

18
00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:00.969
但是网络在这个信任系统上运行，它是一系列的协议
But the Internet runs on this trust
system, and it's a series of protocols

19
00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.349
大家都坐下来同意 30 年前的事了
that everybody sat down to agree
to like 30 years ago or something.

20
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.819
他们说，哎，这就是我电脑跟你说话的方式。
They said, hey,
this is how my computer can talk to you.

21
00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.989
这个协议叫做 IP ，就代表了
And that protocol is called IP,
and that just stands for

22
00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.670
互联网协议非常容易记住
Internet Protocol,
pretty easy to remember.

23
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.239
你可能听到了 TCP/IP
You've probably heard TCP/IP.

24
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:19.890
TCP 是传输控制协议，我们将在第二个方面谈论这个问题。
TCP is Transmission Control Protocol,
we'll talk about that in a second.

25
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.411
但这只是一个集体的想法如果我给你发送一些数据
But it's just this collective idea that
if I send you some data it's well-formed

26
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:27.697
好吧我知道怎么接受这个数据
enough that you say, okay,
I know how to accept this data.

27
00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.947
我知道怎么写，念，我知道怎么发给你
I know how to write it, read it, and
I know how to send it back to you to

28
00:01:30.947 --> 00:01:33.823
让你知道我拿到了那是互联网协议
let you know that I got it,
that's the Internet Protocol.

29
00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.530
你可能都熟悉的 IP 地址
IP address you're probably
all familiar with.

30
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.741
这是一组数字只代表一个地址
It's a set of numbers that
just denotes an address,

31
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:41.299
就像一个邮政地址一样
just like a postal address, same thing.

32
00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:47.219
>> Jem Young: IPv4，这就是我成长的地方。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: IPv4,
that's the thing that I grew up with.

33
00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.859
这只是一系列的数字，更短，还有等待，
That's just a series of numbers,
much shorter, there are, wait,

34
00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.677
我想我的秘密笔记有了
I think I have it in my secret notes,
I do.

35
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:59.180
有 43 亿 IP 地址，当时人们是这样说的，
There are 4.3 billion IP addresses,
which at the time people were like,

36
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.849
就不会有更多的电脑了
there will never be more
computers than that.

37
00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.069
我们已经过去了
We've already blown past that.

38
00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.120
我们实际上已经耗尽了 IP 地址。
We've actually run out of IP addresses.

39
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.069
如果它给你一个关于互联网无所不在的想法，
So if it gives you an idea of
how ubiquitous the Internet is,

40
00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.669
现在互联网上的设备已经超过 34 亿台，
there are over 3.4 billion devices
connected the Internet right now,

41
00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.599
你仔细想想就太疯狂了
which is kind of wild
when you think about it.

42
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.506
但是，这再次说明了你在历史上的一个教训。
But again, this just shows you
a lesson in history to plan ahead.

43
00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.780
他们认为 34 亿是足够的。
[LAUGH] They thought
3.4 billion was enough.

44
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.000
还不够我们跑出来了
It wasn't enough, we ran out.

45
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.250
所以他们发明了这个叫做 IPv6的东西。
So they invented this thing called IPv6.

46
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.199
IPv6 是这样的序列。
IPv6 is a series looks like this.

47
00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.990
有更多的数字，等等，看，
There's bigger numbers and
there's, wait, see,

48
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.370
我的笔记有三百四十头狮子
I've got it in my notes, 340 decillion.

49
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.079
我都不知道我是否说对了
I don't even know if
I'm saying that right.

50
00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.370
三十八到三十
3.4 to 10 to the 38.

51
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.569
这已经足够了。
That is hopefully enough.

52
00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.550
[ LAUGH] 希望有足够的地址，我们很快就不会跑出来了。
[LAUGH] Hopefully enough addresses
that we won't run out anytime soon.

53
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.054
我们会看到未来会发生什么但你永远不会知道
We'll see what happens in the future,
though, you never know.

54
00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:55.340
也许我们会去火星的时候我就死了
Maybe we'll go to Mars and
by that time I'll be dead and hopefully

55
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.090
没有人在看这门课，因为，如果是的话，我们这个世界还有更大的问题。
no one's watching this course because, if
so, we have bigger problems in the world.

56
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.569
但这些是 IP 地址。
But these are IP addresses.

57
00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.240
所以他们是互联网协议使用的地址
So they're addresses that
are used by the Internet Protocol

58
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.590
彼此交谈，让你知道，嘿，我来了。
to kind of talk to each other,
just let you know, hey, here I am.

59
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.189
这就是怎么找我的
Here's how to get to me.

60
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.439
就像我说的，这都是在一个叫做 TCP的不同的协议上运行的。
Like I said, this all runs on
a different protocol called TCP.

61
00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:20.931
大多数人听到 TCP over IP，或者 IP over TCP ，它只是一个协议和
And most of you heard TCP over IP, or
IP over TCP, it's just a protocol and

62
00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:26.189
计算机如何能够相互对话的标准化。
a standardization of how
computers can talk to each other.

63
00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.870
你也听到了 UDP的短语。
And you also hear the phrase UDP.

64
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.150
也许人们对 UDP 不太熟悉，因为它是
Probably people are a little less
familiar with UDP because it's

65
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.530
但你很可能每天都不使用它
used heavily but you probably
don't use it in your day to day.

66
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.439
有谁知道 TCP 和 UDP 之间的区别吗 ?
Does anybody know the difference
between TCP and UDP?

67
00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.139
萨姆我看到你点头了
Sam, I see you nodding.

68
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.658
还有人想去吗
Anybody else want to take a crack?

69
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.795
有人吗
Anybody?

70
00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:47.415
吉米
Jimmy.

71
00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:56.710
>> 扬声器 2: TCP 必须为每个文件协商连接。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: TCP has to negotiate
the connection for each file.

72
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.860
UDP 能够协商连接和
UDP is capable of
negotiating a connection and

73
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.560
然后在与同一服务器通信时将连接打开。
then it leaves the connection open while
it's communicating with the same server.

74
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.069
一完成上传或下载第一个文件就行了，好的，
As soon as it finishes uploading or
downloading the first files it says, okay,

75
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.990
然后再下一次
and then next and then next.

76
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.680
所以它最小化了往返的次数，或者来回的对话，
So it minimizes the round trips, or
the back and forth conversation, that's

77
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.860
以便开始传输和继续传输文件。
needed in order to begin transferring and
continue transferring files.

78
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.879
>> Jem Young: 这就是正确的答案。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's exactly right,
great answer.

79
00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.089
TCP 是无损的，它保证
TCP it's lossless, it's guaranteed that

80
00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:29.649
如果我给你寄一些关于 TCP 的信息
if I send you some information
over TCP it's going to make it.

81
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:31.949
它有一个叫做纠错，错误检查的东西。
It has things called error correction,
error checking.

82
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.810
UDP 和我说的不同
UDP is different where I just say, hey,

83
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.430
我想你也听到了我不在乎你是否不知道那是 UDP
and I assume you heard me and I don't
care if you didn't, and that's UDP.

84
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.459
基本上，这只是一个单向的信息爆炸。
Essentially, it's just
a one-way blast of information.

85
00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:49.399
你可以看到为什么 UDP 的速度比 TCP 快，因为 TCP 必须说，嘿，你在吗 ?
And you can see why UDP is faster than TCP
because TCP has to say, hey, you there?

86
00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.149
这叫做 SYN 包， S-Y-N 。
And that's called a SYN packet, S-Y-N.

87
00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:55.430
然后客户回答，是的，我在这里有一个 ACK。
And then the client responds like,
yeah, I'm here with an ACK.

88
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.759
所以它发送了一个 ACK 包。
So it sends an ACK package.

89
00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.199
你不需要知道这些东西但就像那个书呆子
You don't need to know this stuff, but
it's just like that nerd level trivia that

90
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.300
我我想让你下次出门时在酒吧里看起来很酷
I, I wanna make you look cool at
the bar next time you're hanging out.

91
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.740
你就像是某种东西的 TCP 和 IP 信息包之类的
You're like, yeah, something's TCP and
IP packets, things like that.

92
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.689
但它会谈判这一联系。
But it negotiates this connection.

93
00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.680
所以它是 SYN ，然后是 SYN-ACK ，然后发送 ACK，
So it says SYN and then it says SYN-ACK,
and then it sends ACK, and

94
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.089
然后开始传输数据。
then you start transferring data.

95
00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.959
所以在任何数据之前就已经有 4 个或 5 个连接
So there's already four or
five connections before any data is

96
00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:24.379
甚至是发送和 UDP ，就是，哎，你明白吗 ?
even really sent versus UDP which is just,
hey, did you get it?

97
00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:25.860
你拿到了吗 你拿到了吗
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

98
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.970
别在意了
Don't care.

99
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.894
我只是给你发数据
I'm just sending you data.

100
00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.410
我只是给你发数据
I'm just sending you data.

101
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.396
事实上，我有一个关于 UDP 的好笑话，但你可能不明白。
And actually I have a good joke
about UDP but you might not get it.

102
00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:35.983
>> 演讲者 3: 只是说说而已。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just say it, though.

103
00:05:35.983 --> 00:05:37.278
>> Jem Young: 不，这就是玩笑。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No, that was the joke.

104
00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:37.880
看见了吗
See?

105
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.850
>> 演讲者 3: [LAUGH] >> Jem Young:
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Thank you,

106
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.459
谢谢你在房间的后面
thank you person in the back of the room.

107
00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:42.740
那是马克
That was Mark.

108
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.060
对你是个怪人笑话
Yeah, that was some nerd jokes for you.

109
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.959
所以，让我们尝试练习，让我们试试 ping。
So let's try an exercise, let's try ping.

110
00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.409
Ping 是一个非常简短的请求。
Ping is a really short request.

111
00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:58.840
上面写着，嘿，嘿，嘿，这就是它的全部。
It just says, hey, hey, hey,
hey, that's all it does.

112
00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:05.257
所以，让我们在 twitter.com 和您的终端上，让我来做这个。
So let's go in ping twitter.com and into
your terminal, so I'm gonna do that here.

113
00:06:05.257 --> 00:06:10.160
请登录 twitter.com。
Say ping twitter.com.

114
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.550
嘿它在那儿它还活着
Hey, it's there, it's alive.

115
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.588
杀死它只是 Ctrl+C 。
And to kill it we just Ctrl+C.

116
00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:16.923
杀死任何东西的方法， Ctrl+C 。
Way to kill anything, Ctrl+C.

117
00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:21.704
所以大家都成功了我想如果你在网上看我
So everybody successfully, I assume if
you're watching me on the Internet your

118
00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:25.310
互联网工程和您成功地 ping 通了 twitter.com。
Internet works and
you successfully pinged twitter.com.

119
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.012
这一切都是说你在吗
And all this is saying is,
hey, are you there?

120
00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:28.600
在吗 ?
Are you there?

121
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.100
在吗 ?
Are you there?

122
00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.340
所以我来了我来了我来了
And so like, yeah, I'm here,
I'm here, I'm here.

123
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.129
Ping 可用于调试站点。
Ping is useful for debugging your site.

124
00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.699
如果你想说我的客户说连接的速度太慢了
If you're saying, man, my clients
are saying the connection's really slow.

125
00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.389
最便宜的最简单的方法是让我的站点启动并运行吗 ?
What's the cheapest, easiest way to
find out is my site up and running?

126
00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.519
那往返时间是多久
And how long's that round trip time?

127
00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:52.730
所以来回是我发包的时候
So the round trip refers to
when I send the packet out and

128
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.990
它会回来我们只是在测量
it comes back, and
we're just measuring that.

129
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.840
另外一个措施是，好，我再谈几个希望。
Another thing it measures is, well,
I'll talk about hops in a second.

130
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.240
我来谈谈跳跳和跟踪路线
I'll talk about hops and trace route.

131
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.560
但平平只是一个不错的实用程序能在你的背兜里说
But ping is just a nice utility to have
in your back pocket just to say like,

132
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.360
哎，站起来了吗 ?

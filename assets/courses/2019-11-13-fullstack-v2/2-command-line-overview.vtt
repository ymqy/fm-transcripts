00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.030
>> Jem Young: 我们将以命令行开头。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We'll start
with the command line.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.250
有人知道什么是命令行吗 ?
Anybody know what command line is?

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.650
假设每个人都可以
Assuming everybody.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.390
是啊看起来像这样
Yeah, it looks something like this.

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.699
我要换个开关
I'm gonna switch over.

6
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.739
所以我可以跟你打声招呼
So I can say, echo hi.

7
00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.138
什么 ?
Says, hi.

8
00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.449
在这里做遇回的东西
Groundbreaking stuff here.

9
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.460
我们今天要做的事都在指挥线上
A lot of what we're gonna do
today is on the command line.

10
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.609
实际上我们今天要做的事都在指挥线上
Actually, most of what we're gonna
do today is on the command line.

11
00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.089
这对人们是有点吓人的
And it's a little intimidating for people.

12
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.309
特别是你只是在用你的鼠标，检查这些东西。
Especially if you're just using your mouse
and inspecting and all these things.

13
00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.219
但到了最后你会喜欢这条命令行的
But by the end of the day,
you're gonna love the command line.

14
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.060
你会看到它很强大，它是可重复的。
You'll see it's so powerful,
it's so repeatable.

15
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.284
真的，你现在就可以把那只老鼠扔出去。
And really, you can just throw
that mouse out right now.

16
00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:41.889
有人有老鼠吗
Anybody have a mouse?

17
00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.832
不开玩笑的
No, just kidding.

18
00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:44.993
别在家里这么做
Don't do that at home.

19
00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:46.920
我不想被怪罪
I don't wanna get blamed for that.

20
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.502
但今天我们对指挥线路会很满意
But today we're gonna be really
comfortable with command line.

21
00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:52.408
我们会看到，它只是一个用户界面，就像其他的一样。
And we're gonna see, it's just a user
interface, just like anything else.

22
00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.390
>> Jem Young: 为什么命令行?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So why the command line?

23
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.840
有人知道为什么指挥线路吗
Anybody, why the command line?

24
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.710
我今天要问很多问题只要习惯就好
I'm gonna ask a lot of questions today,
so just get used to it.

25
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.751
等等我已经听你说过了
Wait, I already heard from you.

26
00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:05.519
泰勒
Taylor?

27
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.019
>> 扬声器 2: 并非所有服务器都有一个 GUI。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not all
servers even have a GUI.

28
00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.349
>> Jem Young: 是的，好的答案，这完全正确。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, good answer,
that's exactly right.

29
00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:14.099
>> 扬声器 3: 没有限制。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's just no limitation.

30
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.584
>> Jem Young: 完全正确。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly.

31
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:18.103
>> 演讲者 3: 不管如何设计一个 GUI ，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No matter how
well designed a GUI is,

32
00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:22.189
你不能把所有的可能性都包括在内
you just cannot encompass
all the possibilities.

33
00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.039
>> Jem Young: 是。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

34
00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.049
>> 扬声器 3: 可以在命令行中使用。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That are capable
in a command line.

35
00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.599
>> Jem Young: 完美，伟大的答案，每个人。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Perfect,
great answers, everyone.

36
00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.412
我喜欢你这么说的 GUI
And I love that you all said GUI.

37
00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:34.885
GUI 代表图形用户界面，对于不熟悉的用户和
GUI stands for graphical user interface,
for those who are unfamiliar and

38
00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:35.811
从来没见过
never seen it.

39
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:38.890
但是 GUIs 已被视化。
But GUIs are opinionated.

40
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.909
是有人对用户应该看到的内容的看法
It's someone's opinion about what
exactly the user should see and

41
00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.479
他们应该如何与之互动
how they should interact with that.

42
00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.615
它的布局是完全背景的。
And how its laid out is
completely contextual.

43
00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:49.256
在另一个国家，也许我根本不理解他们的 GUI 。
In a different country, maybe I
wouldn't understand their GUI at all.

44
00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:52.319
因为我习惯了这边的按钮而不是这边
Because I'm used to the buttons being
on this side instead of this side.

45
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.640
命令行无所不在。
The command line is ubiquitous.

46
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.615
命令行在每个国家或地区使用每种语言。
The command line works in every
language in every country.

47
00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:03.287
每个操作系统都有一个命令行，无论是 Windows， Mac还是 Linux。
Every operating system has a command line,
whether it Windows, Mac, or Linux.

48
00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:04.959
他们都有指挥线路
They all have command lines.

49
00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.377
如果你精通指挥的话如果你真的很擅长
And if you're proficient at the command
line, if you're really good,

50
00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:11.973
我在这层附近没有地方所以我不会说你会更快
I'm nowhere near this level, so
[LAUGH] I won't say that you'll be faster.

51
00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:14.860
但通常来说，在命令行上做得更快。
But it is faster doing things on
the command line, generally speaking.

52
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.877
它是一致的，命令行总是一致的。
It's consistent, the command
line's always gonna be the same.

53
00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:22.460
如果我们讨论的是 Linux，这些命令通常是一样的。
The commands are generally gonna be
the same, if we're talking about Linux.

54
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.030
说实话，剧本更容易做，比 GUIs 更容易自动化。
And honestly, it's easier to script,
it's easier to automate than GUIs.

55
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.300
您可以编写 GUI 来自动执行鼠标移动以及所有其他操作。
And you can write GUIs to automate mouse
movements and all these other things.

56
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.379
但命令行就是它的力量所在
But the command line is just,
it's where the power's at.

57
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.805
最初，当计算机首次被发明时，它是所有人都拥有的。
And originally, when computers were
first invented, it's all people had.

58
00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:40.728
> > Jem Young: 我们把它放在那里。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We'll just keep it there.

59
00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.550
所有这些都是接入命令线路的终端。
All they had were were terminals
which access command line.

60
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.033
而且没有一个 GUI之类的东西。
And there was no such thing as a GUI.

61
00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:49.593
这就是为什么 Windows 3.1 和 Mac ，以及所有这些
That's why Windows 3.1 and Mac,
and all these things we take for

62
00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:51.925
被揭露的事实
granted now, were revelations.

63
00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:54.909
因为它使计算机变得更容易获取。
Because it made computers more accessible.

64
00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.539
但如果你回到过去的学校
But if you go back to the old school days,

65
00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.319
硬盘上的平台是你能旋转的
the place where platters on hard
drives were this big you could spin

66
00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.069
手动获取您需要访问该数据的确切位置。
them manually to get exactly where
you needed to be to access that data.

67
00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.439
这些人都是用指挥线路和 GUIs 就像，哇，
Those people were all using command
line and GUIs were just like, wow,

68
00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.979
那就太好了也许有一天
that'd be fantastic, maybe someday.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.349
>> Jem Young: 要完成 HP 部分，我们花费了一段时间。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: To finish off the HP
section, we spent a while on it.

2
00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.940
真是太好了
That's pretty rewarding.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.830
我们现在有一个在 SSL 和 HP/2 上运行的现代化网站，你在想，
We now have a modern site running on
SSL and HP/2 and you're thinking,

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.210
太棒了但  很快就会出来了
that's great, but
HTTP/3 is coming out soon, too.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.111
我觉得我刚弄明白了
I feel like I just figured out HTTP/2.

6
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:17.844
没事的没事的
It's okay.

7
00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:19.068
这是 HTTP/3。
Here's HTTP/3.

8
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:24.109
已退出。
HTTP/3 is out.

9
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.460
但我说出去
But I say out.

10
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.140
互联网在滚动的过程中非常缓慢。
The internet's pretty slow in
terms of rolling things out.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.210
例如，现在只有 42% 的互联网使用
For instance, only about 42% of
the internet uses HTTP/2 now,

12
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.070
尽管它已经被淘汰了好几年了
even though it's been out for years now.

13
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.799
这是一个非常缓慢的进展。
It's a very slow progress.

14
00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:42.070
我指责银行和公司，他们是，我们会去的。
I blame banks and corporations,
they're, yeah we'll get to it.

15
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.801
但是当您运行大量用户的大型服务器时，添加
But when you're running a large server
with thousands of users, adding HTTP/2,

16
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:52.600
添加 SSL 并不像我们在这里所做的那么简单，而且它会花费金钱。
adding SSL is not as easy as we made
it here, and it does cost money.

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.090
你会增加你的服务器时间之类的
You're gonna increase your server time and
things like that.

18
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.823
但是，及时地让人们不再采用  。
But just in time for people not to
adopt HTTP/2, HTTP/3 comes out.

19
00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:02.832
HTTP/2 与
The difference between HTTP/2 and

20
00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:09.950
是所有前代 HTTP 奖励中的  。
HTTP/3 is HTTP/2 in all previous
generations of HTTP bonus.

21
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.530
我今天说过多少次了
How many times did I say HTTP today?

22
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.340
这么多
So many.

23
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.920
但在过去的几代，它们都是通过 TCP运行的。
But all the previous generations,
they all run over TCP.

24
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.789
请记住，它仍然是握手协议，而  使其更快
Remember that it is still that handshake
protocol, while HTTP/2 made it faster

25
00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.469
因为我们多路复用了这一点，所以我们每次都不握手。
because we multiplex that so we are not
doing a handshake every single time.

26
00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.890
这样做还需要付出代价。
There is still a cost to doing that.

27
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.810
他们还在压缩或者
And they are still doing
that compression or

28
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.129
他们还在进行纠错
they are still doing
that error correction.

29
00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:35.670
因此，如果我们想回到我们早先关于 TCP的教训。
So if we think back to our
earlier lesson about TCP.

30
00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.969
TCP 错误更正，因此如果缺少任何包，那么它表示，嘿，一，二，三，
TCP error corrects, so if any packets are
missing, it says, hey, one, two ,three,

31
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.310
四，五，六，七失踪。
four, five, but six and seven are missing.

32
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.569
您将该请求发送至服务器和服务器，我的错误。
And you send that request to
the server and the server's, my bad.

33
00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.609
让我再发一次
Let me send those again.

34
00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.539
这就是 TCP 可靠的原因是必要的
And that's what makes TCP reliable and
it was something that was necessary,

35
00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.270
尤其是在网络的早期连接会下降的时候
especially back in the early days of
the internet when connections would drop.

36
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.920
特别是当我们使用拨号时，它非常容易连接。
Especially when we're using dial up,
which is very prone to lossy connection.

37
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.200
我不知道你有没有用过拨号码再跟我自己约会
I don't know if any of you ever
use dial up, dating myself again.

38
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.479
但我不知道你是否知道下载 mp3 的痛苦
But I don't know if you know the pain
of downloading an mp3 you're, yeah,

39
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.110
是新的我不知道谁受欢迎
it's the new, I don't know who's popular..

40
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.620
182 条可能是正确的时间对吧
Blink 182 that was probably that's
about the right time, right?

41
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.599
我在 56K 调制解调器上花了一个小时的下载 Blink 182 。
I spent an hour downloading Blink
182 one song over my 56k modem.

42
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.740
然后有人打个招呼，你就输了。
And then someone picks up the phone
like hello, and you lose it all.

43
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.240
是的，网络连接的旧日是靠不住的，所以
And yes, the old days of the internet
connections were unreliable, so

44
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.439
我们需要有很多纠错的东西
we needed something with
a lot of error correction.

45
00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.539
现在互联网的可靠性更高得多
Now, the internet's much more reliable,
it's much more of a staple,

46
00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:37.500
就像一条电源线，或者你的水位线之类的。
kind of like a power line, or
your water line or something like that.

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.389
谷歌做了什么，他们发明了一种新的协议，
So, what Google did,
was they invented a new protocol called,

48
00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.599
快速 UDP 连接。
Quick UDP Connections.

49
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.360
因此，我们现在使用基于 UDP的 HTTP 而不是基于 HTTP 的 HTTP 。
So instead of HTTP over TCP,
we now have HTTP over UDP.

50
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.629
从我们早先的经验
And from our earlier lessons,

51
00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.009
记得 UDP 更有爆炸的地方，中共就是，你拿到了吗 ?
remember that UDP is more of a blast,
where CCP is, hey did you get it?

52
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.543
他就像我一样
He's like yeah I got it.

53
00:02:54.543 --> 00:02:58.139
UDP 是我要把你的数据发给你
UDP is I'm gonna send you data and
assuming you got it.

54
00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.590
它有一些纠错的内置，但是因为网络更可靠，
And it has some error correction built in,
but because the internet's more reliable,

55
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.419
我们就快得快得多了
it's much faster cuz we don't
have to do that handshake of sin

56
00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.530
承认和所有这些东西都是 UDP 爆炸的
in acts in acknowledge and
all these other things UDP just blasts.

57
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.245
如果您想检查任何支持 UDP 的内容
If you wanna check if
anything supporting UDP

58
00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:18.099
用更快的 HTTP/3 ，我们可以把 Gmail 拉上来。
using quicker HTTP/3,
we can actually pull up a Gmail.

59
00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.409
我不会把我的 Gmail cuz 拉到我的邮件里
I won't pull my Gmail cuz that's my mail.

60
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.090
但如果你打开你的 Gmail 或谷歌自己的财产
But if you open your Gmail or
something Google own property,

61
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.340
你会在协议中看到它现在说的是 HTTP/quick 46
you'll see in the protocol
it now says HTTP/quick 46.

62
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.079
那是因为 HTTP/3 不太正式。
That's because HTTP/3
is not quite official.

63
00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.520
它不像所有浏览器都支持的那样。
It's not like well supported
by all the browsers.

64
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.629
但是我们现在还不能实现这个
But we, we can't implement this yet

65
00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.699
因为它不太受支持
because it's not really
being supported too much.

66
00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.039
我都不认为 NGINX 是支持它的，我知道， Sam，你知道吗 ?
I don't even think NGINX supports
it far as I know, Sam, do you know?

67
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.829
> > Sam: 否，不离我的头。
&gt;&gt; Sam: No, not off the top of my head.

68
00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.430
我知道灯塔绝对支持
I know that Lighthouse
definitely supports it.

69
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.930
>> Jem Young: 真的吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Really?

70
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.979
那就有道理了
That makes sense.

71
00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.099
这也是谷歌拥有的产品。
That's a Google owned product as well.

72
00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.860
Google 和 Cloudflare 现在支持 。
Google and Cloudflare now support HTTP/3.

73
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.960
我们会看到逐渐采用的方式
We'll see gradual adoption, but

74
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.539
这又是你在未来五年里看到的。
this is again something you'll
see in the next five years or so.

75
00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:08.620
它确实创造了一个 13 岁的婴儿
And it does create a baby 13,
it depends on the connection,

76
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.439
但如在 HTTP/2 上增加 13 % 到 20% 的速度
but say like 13 to 20% speed
increase over HTTP/2 which

77
00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.899
很令人印象深刻因为你认为速度比 HTTP/1 加速
is pretty impressive because you think
that speed increase over HTTP/1, we're

78
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.750
只需配置我们发送数据的方式就能更快地实现 50% 的增长。
talking up to 50% faster just from just
configuring the way we're sending data.

79
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.310
太棒了
That's pretty awesome.

80
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.319
我不知道你的事但那很酷
I don't know about you,
but that's pretty cool.

81
00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.144
可能是完整堆栈的 V3 或
Maybe in version three of full-stack or

82
00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:30.350
前端将能够实现 。
front-end will be able
to implement HTTP/3.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
> > Jem Young: 让我们先开始练习，先练习。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's start off
with an exercise, first exercise.

2
00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.705
我们只会在命令行上弹弹一点点
We're just gonna play around with
the command line, just a little bit,

3
00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.293
只要你舒服就好
just iin case you're comfortable.

4
00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:11.781
我知道你们有些人有富尔萨克的经验，这很棒。
I know some of you have some
Fullsac experience, which is great.

5
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.628
你们中有些人从未接触过指挥系统
Some of you have never touched the command
line, other than, maybe doing Git or

6
00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:16.730
就像这样
something like that.

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.564
所以只要玩玩就知道你不会破坏我的
So, just play around with it, knowing
you're probably not gonna break anything I

8
00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:24.373
说也许我不在你的电脑里而且我不知道你在做什么
say probably cuz I'm not at your computer,
and I don't know what you're doing.

9
00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:27.100
我不知道你是否坐在家里看 Netflix的沙发上
I don't know if you're sitting on
a couch at home watching Netflix,

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.329
而不是真正的关注
not really paying attention.

11
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.586
别担心我今天不会带你走太远的
But don't worry, I'm not gonna
lead you too far astray today.

12
00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:37.590
命令行已经是命令行了
The command line has,
well, it's a command line.

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.140
它有不同的指令来做事情。
It had different commands to do things.

14
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.308
这些是一些比较熟悉的，我一直使用的。
These are some of the more familiar ones,
and the ones that I use all the time.

15
00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:45.686
今天我们要用 cd 的
Today, we're gonna use cd a lot.

16
00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:47.012
这只是移动目录
That's just moving directories.

17
00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.256
Pwd 很有用，总是像我的密码，但是
Pwd is useful,
it always looks like password to me, but

18
00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.192
是打印工作目录
it's print working directory.

19
00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:55.003
其实我现在就做一些例子。
Actually, I'll just do some examples now.

20
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.683
所以就在这里执行
So, oops, execute over here.

21
00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:01.618
如果要清除，您就可以在命令行中输入明文。
And if you want to clear you can just
type clear in your command line.

22
00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:06.918
所以如果我想说 pwd，意思是我用斜杠，我在我电脑的根目录中。
So if I wanna say pwd, which means I'm in
slash, I'm in the root of my computer.

23
00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:11.814
Ls 会列出所有档案我可以说
Ls is gonna list all the files and
I can say, ls,

24
00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:15.865
我会用砍伤的方式说
actually I'll say cd into slash etcd.

25
00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:19.269
现在我在等你
Now, I'm in etc.

26
00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:25.379
后面的 cd1 不见了只有 cd1
And the back out cd1 to go nowhere,
just cd1.

27
00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.774
你可能很熟悉 synod
You're probably familiar with the synod,

28
00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:31.668
如果要获取同一目录中的文件，只需点斜杠。
if you want to acquire a file in
the same directory, you just dot slash.

29
00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.582
Cd 点点表示移动目录。
Cd dot dot means move up directory.

30
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:36.329
点点表示移动两个目录，等等。
Dot dot dot means move up two directories,
etc., etc.

31
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.993
我知道我要去做基本的工作
I know I'm going over the basics.

32
00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:39.135
这才是今天要走的
That's how this day's going to go.

33
00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:42.299
我们会慢慢起步的
We're going to start off really slow.

34
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.012
这么慢你就像我为什么来这里
So slow, you're like, why am I here?

35
00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:49.396
伙计这不是我能一直看的不好的主意我不知道体育舞会
Man, this is bad idea I could have been
watching, I don't know sports ball or

36
00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:50.145
什么东西
something.

37
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:53.250
但我在这，我们正在做这些基本的事情。
But I'm, here,
which we're doing these basic things.

38
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.204
但我们要慢慢来我们需要命令行
But we start off slow we will
need the command line, so

39
00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:57.658
和它一起玩
play around with it a bit.

40
00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:01.941
猫真的很有用如果你想把文件给你
Cat is really useful if you wanna
file you just cat a file and

41
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:03.963
只要打印输出就好了
just print out the output.

42
00:02:03.963 --> 00:02:09.538
伙计我们会用的因为你不知道所有的命令
Man, we're gonna use, just because
you won't know all the commands.

43
00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:13.877
如果你想知道我们能做什么
And if you're ever curious
about something we can do

44
00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:18.322
像猫一样把猫的手拉上来
things like man cat and
it pulls up the manual for cat.

45
00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:22.534
总是有用的，我说的是男人的页面，不是所有的阳光和玫瑰。
Always useful, I'll say this about man
pages, are not all sunshine and roses.

46
00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:25.860
在 Linux 的土地上一切都很好，一切都很有道理。
Everything's great in Linux land and
it all makes so much sense.

47
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.609
人的页面不容易阅读。
Man pages are not easy to read.

48
00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.551
我推荐的通常只是查询搜索， Google， Bing，什么
What I recommend usually is just doing
a query search, Google, Bing, whatever

49
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:37.366
首选搜索引擎用于您尝试使用的实际命令。
your preferred search engine is for
the actual command you're trying to use.

50
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:42.795
但是用这个男人页的基本点告诉你
But for basic things using the man
page just tells you what it's supposed

51
00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:48.060
如果你想搜查你就能找到刀把我不知道猫
to do and if you wanna search you can
type slash and I don't know, cat.

52
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.776
它会拉起东西
And it pulls up things.

53
00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:54.695
我可以它一直在动
And I can, it keeps moving.

54
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:56.331
而要退出，只需输入 q。
And to quit, just type q.

55
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:59.514
我有一些关于杀人和所有这些事的笑话
I had some jokes about man kill and
all these things, but

56
00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:01.626
我觉得他们不合适
I thought they were inappropriate.

57
00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.981
没有吗
No?

58
00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:05.243
他们不合适
They're not inappropriate.

59
00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:07.758
所以杀人只是杀死一个过程的一种方式。
So kill is just a way
of killing a process.

60
00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:12.284
我们希望不要用杀戮来做任何事情。
And we hopefully won't do anything
that requires using kill.

61
00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:13.912
但如果你被困在某个地方
But if you get stuck somewhere and

62
00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:16.247
有一个过程就是我要怎么杀死它
there is a process just
running how do I kill it?

63
00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:18.937
您按流程名称开始终止。
You start kill by process name.

64
00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:23.568
Pkill 是有用的，因为它不使用正在运行的东西的想法，
Pkill is useful because instead of using
the idea of the thing that's running,

65
00:03:23.568 --> 00:03:27.782
我只能输入 pkill 节点，而我没有任何节点进程正在运行，但是
I can just type pkill node and
I don't have any node process running, but

66
00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:29.664
它会杀死你的节点进程
it'll kill your node process.

67
00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:33.050
由于工作节点过程中的 [LAUGH] 挂起，所以我使用了很多
This one I use a lot because [LAUGH] at
work our node process gets hung up and

68
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.074
这很令人沮丧
it's frustrating.

69
00:03:34.074 --> 00:03:39.531
没事的没事的
It's okay.

70
00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:42.712
如果你想删除文件 rm 很解释
If you wanna remove file,
rm, pretty explanatory.

71
00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:47.784
Echo 重复一个文件或对输入的任何内容重复输入。
Echo repeats a file or
repeats an input for whatever you type in.

72
00:03:47.784 --> 00:03:53.926
Ls 是有用的， ls 就像猫，只会显示一切。
Ls is useful, ls is like cat
except cat displays everything.

73
00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.168
所以如果你有一个兆字节文件，猫就会把它丢在你的屏幕上，
So if you have a one megabyte file,
cat will just dump it all to your screen,

74
00:03:57.168 --> 00:03:59.388
有时你会想有时你不愿意
which sometimes you want,
sometimes you don't.

75
00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:03.050
Ls 就像一只更好的猫，一次只做一页。
Ls is like a better cat,
where it only does one page at a time.

76
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.537
所以它比猫更有用，但我们可能会在两者之间切换。
So it's a bit more useful than cat, but
we'll probably switch off between both.

77
00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:14.413
如果要创建目录 mkdir，请除去目录 rmdir。
If you want to make a directory mkdir,
remove directory rmdir, yeah.

78
00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:16.072
这对任何人都很熟悉吗
Is this familiar to anybody?

79
00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:19.024
你之前大概都见过这一切但是
No you've probably all seen
most of this before, but

80
00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.595
把它放在一个结构上是好事
it's good to kind of lay
it out as a structure.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.746
>> Jem Young: 所以我之前教了 IP 表，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
I previously have taught about IP tables,

2
00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:07.198
是路由，阻塞或
which are ways of routing, blocking, or

3
00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:12.242
拒绝某些端口对某些协议的请求。
denying requests to certain
ports over certain protocols.

4
00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:15.807
但他们真的很麻烦
But they're really onerous.

5
00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:19.960
如果你不能在这里说，这不是一个非常友好的语法。
And if you can't tell here,
it's not a very friendly syntax.

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.544
幸运的是开放软件基金会和 Ubuntu 的那种人
Fortunately the kind people at the Open
Software Foundation and Ubuntu and

7
00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:29.416
Linux和互联网上的优秀公民创造了一些东西
Linux, and just the good citizens of
the Internet, created something a little

8
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:33.435
更轻量的称为 ufw ，不复杂的防火墙。
bit more lightweight called ufw,
the uncomplicated firewall.

9
00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:39.280
如果你不能说，这一不复杂的防火墙将会变得不那么复杂。
If you can't tell, this uncomplicated
firewall will be much less complicated.

10
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.996
再次，防火墙仅控制对这些端口的访问
And again, a firewall just controls
the access to these ports and

11
00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:46.845
能从你电脑里出来的人
who can get in and out of your computer.

12
00:00:48.072 --> 00:00:52.286
>> Jem Young: 与 IP 表不同， ufw 的语法更简单
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And unlike IP tables,
ufw has a much simpler syntax for

13
00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:53.667
基本服务。
basic services.

14
00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:57.631
因此，如果我拒绝说 HPS 的话，我可以说，我可以否认 HPS。
So if I want to deny say
HPS I can say ufw deny HPS.

15
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:02.573
当你在表面上思考的时候
And it's much easier to reason about when
you're think about on a surface level

16
00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:04.215
而不是端口级别。
rather than a port level.

17
00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:07.543
我不需要这样想我也不用想
And I don't have to be like,
I don't have to think,

18
00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.658
我要阻止所有 TCP 流量到端口 4430。
I want to block all TCP
traffic to port 4430.

19
00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:15.100
不，我只能说 UFW 否认 HPS ，它会阻止所有流量到端口 443。
No, I can just say UFW deny HPS, and
it's gonna block all traffic to port 443.

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.771
所以现在它没有在运行。
So right now it's not running.

21
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:21.459
因为你知道我想要什么吗 ?
So let's get it up and
running because you know what I want?

22
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.989
我要关闭 3000 口，对。
I want to close port 3000, yes.

23
00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:28.885
>> 扬声器 2: 拒绝和拒绝之间有什么区别 ?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the difference
between deny and reject?

24
00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:29.710
>> Jem Young: 大问题。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Great question.

25
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.813
我不知道我能不能再考虑一下吗 如果没有的话我马上就来
I wonder if I cover that later?
If not, I'll cover right now.

26
00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:36.819
所以否认是，我在努力记住这一差异。
So deny is,
I'm trying to remember the difference.

27
00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.373
拒绝黑洞请求，好的，它不响应请求。
Deny black holes requests, okay,
it doesn't respond to requests.

28
00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:46.170
所以如果我想进入港口我不知道 47号我能 ping 到那个港口
So if I'm trying to get into port, I don't
know, 47, I can just ping that port or

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.890
尝试访问它，它会挂起来，它会挂起来挂起来。
try to access it, it'll just hang,
it'll just hang and hang.

30
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.365
但我已经放弃了这一要求
But internally I've already
dropped that request.

31
00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:57.500
我什么都没做但我不会明确回应港口是封闭的
I didn't do anything about it, but I won't
respond explicitly that port is closed.

32
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.129
拒绝说明， hey，此端口已关闭，并将包发送回服务器。
Reject says, hey, this port is closed,
and it sends a packet back to the server.

33
00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.549
有时候你想明确告诉别人
The difference is sometimes you wanna
be explicit about telling people that

34
00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.693
端口是关闭的，或者类似您使用错误端口的端口，或者
the port is closed, or something
like you're using the wrong port, or

35
00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:12.266
您正在尝试访问错误的服务器。
you're trying to access the wrong server.

36
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.443
你想成为那些试图使用你服务的人的好公民
You wanna be a good citizen to
the people trying to use your service.

37
00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:17.699
当你想黑洞的时候
Other times you wanna black hole them and

38
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.961
别让他们告诉他们发生了什么
not let them tell them anything
about what's happening.

39
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:24.549
你不知道那港口是开放的还是只是花了很长时间来回应
You don't know if that port's open or if
it's just taking a long time to respond or

40
00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.075
任何事
anything.

41
00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:29.305
通常你总是想要黑洞的要求除非你有特定的情况
Generally you always wanna black hole
requests, unless you have a specific case

42
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:33.223
当你想告诉人们你想进入的服务是
when you wanna tell people that the
service that you're trying to access is

43
00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:36.670
不正确或参数无效或类似的情况。
incorrect or the parameters are invalid or
something like that.

44
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.641
但我很惊讶他们没把它放进去
Great question though, I'm surprised
they didn't put it in there, and

45
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.987
我可以后退，等待，否，拒绝或拒绝，是。
I could have it backwards,
wait, no, deny or reject, yes.

46
00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:47.468
像刚才我们在 ping 的一个例子
A lot like the example we gave
earlier when we're trying to ping

47
00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:50.372
frontendmasters.com 和它的挂断。
frontendmasters.com and
it just hangs and hangs.

48
00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:54.567
这是一种好的方式，我会说放慢袭击者的速度。
That's a good way of kind of,
I'll say slowing down attackers.

49
00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:58.365
我不想否认袭击者的身份因为他们会得到的
I don't wanna say deny attackers
because they'll get around that.

50
00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:01.635
但是每次尝试去吃资源都是好办法
But it's good way of kind of eating
resources cuz every time they try to

51
00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:05.127
连接到一个只黑洞的服务它只会挂起和挂起
connect to a service that just black
holes them, it just hangs and hangs and

52
00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:08.800
它会吃掉他们的电脑资源，它会减慢他们的爬行速度。
it eats their computer resources,
it kind of slows down their port crawling.

53
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.068
Versus 拒绝明确表示您不允许执行此操作。
Versus reject which is explicitly
saying you're not allowed to do that.

54
00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:13.786
问得好
Great question though.

55
00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:21.848
>> Jem Young: 所以已安装了 ufw ，但它可能未在运行，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So ufw's installed but
it may not be running,

56
00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:24.810
但我们还是去看看吧
but let's check it out.

57
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.223
因此， sudo ufw 状态， >> Jem Young: 它处于不活动状态。
So sudo ufw status,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's inactive.

58
00:03:31.223 --> 00:03:35.192
所以我想说苏多开始吧
So I'm gonna say sudo ufw start,
should do it.

59
00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:37.473
它不启用。
It does not enable.

60
00:03:37.473 --> 00:03:38.608
我一直这么做
I always do that.

61
00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:40.742
sudo ufw 启用。
sudo ufw enable.

62
00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:47.054
>> Jem Young: 这可能会中断我的现有 SSH 连接，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And this may interrupt
my existing SSH connection,

63
00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:50.441
所以我们只能说 " 是"
so we're just gonna say yes.

64
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.963
>> Jem Young: 我们很棒。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And we're good.

65
00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:57.364
我再给你说一次当你开始安全的时候
I'll say this for you ufw, again,
when you start getting into security and

66
00:03:57.364 --> 00:04:00.402
IP 表和路由， ufw有点容易。
IP tables and routing,
ufw's a little bit easier.

67
00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:03.854
但你完全可以把自己关在服务器之外。
But you can absolutely lock
yourself out of the server.

68
00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:08.420
如果关闭端口 22 ( 这是我的 SSH 端口 ) ，我无法进入服务器
If I close port 22, which is my SSH port,
I have no way of getting into the server

69
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.526
在那个时候我被关了所以很小心
at that point and I'm locked out,
so be very careful.

70
00:04:11.526 --> 00:04:15.687
好吧你可能不会做什么坏事
ufw's okay, you're probably not
gonna do anything too bad, but

71
00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:19.550
如果您开始拒绝 SSH 请求或将其黑色保留在其中，
if you start rejecting SSH requests or
black holeing them in,

72
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.302
你会在一个受伤的世界里无法进入服务器
you'll be in a world of hurt cuz there's
no way to get in the server that point

73
00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:28.567
因为港口已经关闭了它就在某个地方被锁住了
because the port is closed,
it's literally locked up somewhere.

74
00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:33.060
>> Jem Young: 但是我们允许 SSH ，所以我们没问题。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But
we allowed SSH, so we're okay.

75
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.937
因此，让我们再次运行 ufw 状态以查看打开的内容。
So let's run ufw status
again to see what's open.

76
00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:41.363
所以 sudo ufw 状态应该已启动并正在运行，并且它正在运行。
So sudo ufw status should be up and
running, and it's running.

77
00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:48.939
>> Jem Young: 让我们找到命令，告诉我什么是路径
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And let's find the command
to show me what is the routes

78
00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:54.654
他们在跑你的防火墙状态是什么
they're running,
what's your firewall status?

79
00:04:54.654 --> 00:04:56.370
让我们说状态详细。
Let's say status verbose.

80
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:03.826
>> Jem Young: 没有，现在我们还可以，因为我们
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nothing, so
right now we're still okay because we

81
00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:07.596
完全没把自己关起来
didn't lock ourselves out completely.

82
00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:13.889
但我要确保我有这个规则所以 sudo ufw 允许 ssh
But I'm just gonna make sure I had
a rule for this, so sudo ufw allow ssh.

83
00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.819
现在，当我上去的时候，我们看到我们为现在的 SSH 添加了一个规则。
Now when I do go up, we see that
we added a rule for SSH for now.

84
00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.292
当你打开状态时它就会打开
It stays open because
when you turn on ufw,

85
00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:27.031
缺省情况下，不会阻塞 SSH 端口，因为它们知道如果已启用
by default it's not gonna block your SSH
port because they know that if you enabled

86
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.238
当你在你的服务器上你就被开除了然后你就被关了
it when you're on your server you get
kicked out and then you locked out.

87
00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:36.122
幸运的是有人试图让事情变得更容易些
Fortunately, there are people that they
try to make things a little bit easier

88
00:05:36.122 --> 00:05:36.721
给你的
for you.

89
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.656
我们想让一些其他的事情，或者其实，对不起，
We want to enable a few other things,
or actually, sorry,

90
00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:41.262
我们都没做过
we didn't actually enable it.

91
00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:44.651
或者没有，我们已经做到了。
Or no, we did already enable it.

92
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:50.209
我想允许其他的事情所以我想允许 HTTP
Well I wanna allow a few other things,
so I wanna allow HTTP.

93
00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:55.228
因此 sudo ufw 允许 htp ，并且您再次授予状态，
So sudo ufw allow htp, and
you grant status again,

94
00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:58.981
我们看到了防火墙的状态
and we see the status of our firewall.

95
00:05:58.981 --> 00:06:02.779
这是一个比 IP 表更友好的语法。
This is a much, much,
much friendlier syntax than IP tables.

96
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:08.060
我不知道你们有没有做过 IP 表的事
[LAUGH] I don't know if any of you have
ever done anything with IP tables,

97
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.899
但他们根本不友善，一旦你仁慈了就会有道理
but they are not friendly at all,
and they make sense once you kind

98
00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.601
了解语法和所发生的事情
of understand the syntax and
what's happening.

99
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:20.194
但是， ufw 只是一个很好的包装器，一个环绕 IP 表的清洁包装器。
But ufw is just a nice wrapper,
a clean wrapper around IP tables.

100
00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.846
>> Jem Young: 是的，这只是展示状态，对。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
that's just showing status, yes.

101
00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:25.834
>演讲者 3: 我们将允许  和
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We're gonna allow HTTPS and

102
00:06:25.834 --> 00:06:29.814
然后使用 Nginx 将所有 HTTP 流量重定向到 ?
then use Nginx to redirect all
the HTTP traffic to HTTPS?

103
00:06:29.814 --> 00:06:31.141
> > Jem Young: 是的，你在向前跳。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, you're jumping ahead.

104
00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.165
不没关系的
[LAUGH] No, it's okay.

105
00:06:33.165 --> 00:06:37.692
我们最终会打开  端口，那就是 443 端口，
We will eventually, we're gonna open
the HTTPS port, so that's port 443,

106
00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:38.968
当我们打开 的时候
when we turn on HTTPS.

107
00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.050
那一会儿就会发生了
And that'll happen a little bit later.

108
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.394
所以用 ufw 不看，我怎么创造
So using ufw without it looking it up,
how would I create

109
00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:52.305
要阻止所有 HTTP 连接的规则吗 ?
a rule to block all HTTP
connections if I wanted to?

110
00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.196
这不是什么把戏
It's not a trick?

111
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:58.206
>> Jem Young: 任何人，别让我打电话给你。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Anybody,
don't make me call on you.

112
00:06:58.206 --> 00:06:59.906
>> 扬声器 4:ufw 拒绝?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: ufw reject?

113
00:06:59.906 --> 00:07:01.271
>> Jem Young: 是的，拒绝什么?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, reject what?

114
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:02.093
>> 演讲者 4: HTTP。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: HTTP.

115
00:07:02.093 --> 00:07:02.978
>> Jem Young: 对，没什么。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, nothing to it.

116
00:07:02.978 --> 00:07:07.228
这就是为什么它被称为不复杂的防火墙。
And that's why it's called
the uncomplicated firewall.

117
00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:09.416
它只是简化了防火墙
It just simplifies your firewall and

118
00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:12.884
它让我们很容易明白发生了什么
it makes it really easy to
understand what's happening.

119
00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:15.348
>> Jem Young: sudo 拒绝 http， nice.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: sudo reject http, nice.

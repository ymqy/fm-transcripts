00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:02.983
>> Jem Young: 我一直说港口和我之前应该定义的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I keep saying ports and
I should have defined that earlier.

2
00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:08.172
这是映射到特定进程或网络服务的通信端点。
It's a communication endpoint that maps
to a specific process or network service.

3
00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:12.609
为什么港口呢 ?
Now what, so why ports?

4
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.597
在考虑操作系统级别时，为何需要端口
In terms of think about an operating
system level, why would I need a port for

5
00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:17.292
什么
something?

6
00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:20.774
>> Jem Young: 是的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

7
00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.772
>> 演讲者 2: 就像在电视上换频道一样。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's like changing
the channel on your TV.

8
00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:27.399
它使您能够以特定的通信方式进行拨号。
It lets you dial in a specific
mode of communication.

9
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.013
>> Jem Young: 是的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

10
00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:33.058
> 演讲者 2: 让你的花生酱与巧克力分离。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And let you keep your peanut
butter separate from your chocolate.

11
00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:34.587
>> Jem Young: 花生酱和巧克力?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Peanut butter and chocolate?

12
00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:36.411
> 演讲者 2: 这是一个旧的 Reese 花生酱杯广告。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's an old Reese's
peanut butter cup commercial.

13
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.502
>> 演讲者 2: 但是的，关键是能够具体点，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But yeah,
the point is to be able to be specific,

14
00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:48.030
跟你说的一个节目  还是什么的
to talk to one program that's talking to
you, FTP versus HTTP versus whatever.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.222
>> Jem Young: 没错，在一台电脑上，我可以点击 IP 地址，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly, on a computer,
I can hit an IP address,

16
00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:52.747
就像很酷
and it's like, cool.

17
00:00:52.747 --> 00:00:53.710
我现在去哪
Where do I go now?

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.174
但是通过指定端口，
But by specifying the port,

19
00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:58.052
我可以准确地说我想去哪里
I can say exactly where I want
this communication to go.

20
00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:02.200
这比拥有万亿个 IP 地址的效率要高得多
This is much more efficient than having
a trillion IP addresses where every single

21
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.013
IP 地址是不同的服务。
IP address is a different service.

22
00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.323
我们可以命中一个 IP 地址，并且具有不同的端口。
We can hit one IP address and
have different ports.

23
00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:12.087
港口的危险之处在于，每个开放给互联网的港口
The dangerous thing about ports, is that,
every port that is open to the Internet

24
00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:16.180
这意味着它很容易被利用
means it's a vulnerability,
potentially, that can be exploited.

25
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.368
因此，通常，您需要运行所需的最小端口数。
So in general, you want the minimum
amount of ports that you need running.

26
00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:23.082
这就是为什么缺省情况下，端口会关闭，直到您打开这些端口为止。
That's why by default,
ports are closed until you open them up.

27
00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:28.076
甚至现在我不希望港口 3000 的开放因为我不需要
And even now I don't want port 3000
open because I don't need that to be

28
00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:29.832
暴露在互联网上
exposed to the Internet.

29
00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:33.811
所以如果我去了，我刚才展示了这个。
So if I went to, and
I demonstrated this earlier.

30
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:40.287
这意味着我可以在 3000 口上最棒的
That means I can go to
jemisthebest on port 3000.

31
00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.478
它仍然连接起来，这不是我们想要的。
And it still connects,
which is not what we want.

32
00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.600
我们只需要 80 端口连接，所有流量都要经过端口 80。
We want only port 80 to connect, and
all traffic to go through port 80.

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.099
因为如果某个时间点我在 3000 端口上启动了另一个服务
Because what if at some point I started
up another service on port 3000, and

34
00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:51.722
我重定向别处
I redirect somewhere else.

35
00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:55.728
我现在有一个开放的港口，它很容易受到爆炸的影响。
I now have an open port that is vulnerable
to exploits or something like that.

36
00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:59.956
因此，一般来说，端口的最佳实践总是使它们保持关闭状态。
So in general, the best practice for
ports is always to keep them closed.

37
00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:03.662
除非您需要打开，并且只打开所需要的显式。
Unless you need to open up, and only
open up the explicit ones that you need.

38
00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:07.069
因为再一次，扫描你需要花费很少的时间，
Because again, it takes a trivial
amount of time to port scan you, and

39
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.913
找出你正在运行什么软件什么是打开的
find out what software you're running and
what's open.

40
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:15.342
>> Jem Young: 如果我们想看到不同版本的端口，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And if we wanna see
a different version of the ports that are,

41
00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:18.058
或者我们可以看到标准港口是什么
or we can see like what
the standard ports are.

42
00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:20.081
他们可能大部分时间都不会开放
They're probably not gonna
be open most of the time.

43
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:23.966
但你可以少说 /etc/ 服务。
But you can say less /etc/ services.

44
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.177
我觉得这很有趣，另一个
And I find it really interesting,
cuz the other,

45
00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:31.015
刚才我们谈到了标准港口的情况。
a bit earlier we talked about
how there are standard ports.

46
00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:34.615
这就是为什么我们总是选择 2000 或 3000 或 1000以上的东西。
That's why we always choose something
above 2000 or 3000 or 1000.

47
00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:38.471
因为有明确定义的端口，如 22。
Because there are well-defined ports,
like 22.

48
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.670
让我们看看这里 FTP 是 21 端口
Let's see what's on here, FTP is port 21.

49
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.449
这些只是事实上的标准，你可以随时改变这些标准。
And these are just de facto standards,
you can change these at any time.

50
00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:49.367
但保留这些标准有时更好。
But it's sometimes better
to keep these standards.

51
00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:52.312
前几天你说过
The other day, Sam, you mentioned,

52
00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:56.823
如果您想的话，可以将您的端口从 22 更改为 " SSH " 。
you can change your port from 22 for
SSH if you wanted to.

53
00:02:56.823 --> 00:03:00.556
你可以但这让 SSHing 有点棘手如果我想说
You could, but that makes SSHing it a
little bit more tricky if I want to, say,

54
00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:01.813
跟你分享我的服务器
share my server with you.

55
00:03:01.813 --> 00:03:07.384
但你绝对可以做到这一点，而且它只会改变港口地图。
But you can absolutely do that, and
it would just change the port map.

56
00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:10.337
有没有关于港口的问题 ?
Is there any question about ports?

57
00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:12.882
你唯一需要知道的是除非你需要他们，否则他们会关闭它们。
The only thing you really need to know is
keep them closed unless you need them.

58
00:03:12.882 --> 00:03:16.989
如果你想给我太长的时间不听杰姆的
[LAUGH] Then if you wanna give a too long,
didn't listen to Jem.

59
00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.665
好吧把他们关了
So yeah, just keep them closed.

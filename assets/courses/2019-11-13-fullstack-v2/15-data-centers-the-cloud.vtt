1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
>> Jem Young: 但是，一般来说，会有一堆服务器。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But, generally, there's
gonna be stacks and stacks of servers.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.097
因此，如果您想将笔记本电脑或台式机或计算机作为服务器进行拍照，
So, if you want to picture your laptop or
your desktop or your computer as a server,

3
00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:10.957
甚至是手机作为服务器你就会有堆和叠堆
or even a cell phone as a server,
you're gonna have stacks and stacks and

4
00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:15.351
这些都是联网的，这样他们就能高效地处理请求。
stacks of these all networked together so
they can handle requests efficiently.

5
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.774
服务器也特别建立。
And servers are particularly built.

6
00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:19.565
如果你为服务器付钱
If you pay money for a server,

7
00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:23.809
他们建立了一种特殊的方法来保护消费者的硬件
they're built particular ways that
consumer grade hardware is not.

8
00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.653
例如，他们可能会纠错内存。
For instance, they're gonna have
probably error correcting memory.

9
00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:30.391
它们的 CPU 速度比一般都快。
They're going to have faster CPUs
than generally are available.

10
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:35.487
他们会有 40 或 50 个核心 CPU ，对于大多数人来说，
They'll have like 40 or 50 core CPUs
which, for most people, would be complete

11
00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:40.320
因为现代软件不能利用这么多的核心
overkill because modern software doesn't
take advantage of that many cores.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.048
多线程技术很难，完全不同。
It's multi threading is hard,
totally different course.

13
00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:46.215
有多线程的课程吗
Is there a course on multi threading?

14
00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.067
我不会教的
I'm not gonna teach that.

15
00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:50.340
这就太艰难了
[LAUGH] That's gonna be way too hard.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.222
但是，为这些情况构建了服务器，并且在您运行应用程序时
But servers are built for these things,
and when you run an application on

17
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.039
一个服务器，它自动地可以派生进程，它可以叉命令，
a server, it automatically can fork
processes, it can fork commands,

18
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.435
它可以在一个线程中处理请求并将其转至另一个线程。
it can handle requests in one thread and
spin off to another one.

19
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:05.673
但服务器本质上是专门为
But servers, essentially,
are custom built machines specifically for

20
00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:09.444
干扰文件，并不一定与之交互。
disturbing files and
not necessarily interacting with as much.

21
00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:14.257
服务器通常居住在一个称为数据中心的地方。
Servers generally live in
a place called data centers.

22
00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:17.188
数据中心是这些机架和机架以及机架和
Data centers are these racks and
racks and racks and

23
00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:22.027
机架和机架和机架机器通常运行非常冷的环境，
racks and racks and racks machines usually
run really, really cold environments,

24
00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:25.451
就因为电脑运行热，服务器就像感冒一样。
just because computers run hot,
servers like to run cold.

25
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.049
它们通常是干净的，所以不会有很多灰尘。
They're usually clean,
so not a lot of dust.

26
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.978
想象一下如果你有，我不知道，有一万个粉丝在跑吗 ?
Imagine if you have, I don't know,
what is this like, 10,000 fans running?

27
00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:35.920
还有一点灰尘在里面会毁了你的日子
[LAUGH] And a little bit of dust gets
in there, it's gonna ruin your day.

28
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.362
所以他们一般都很干净
So they're generally pretty clean.

29
00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.390
他们的安全措施很严密
Security on them is very tight.

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.622
想想一家银行，然后把它翻三倍，
Think of a bank, and then triple that, and

31
00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.049
这就是数据中心的证券
that's what securities
on data centers are.

32
00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.866
因为这是信息，这是权力，这是互联网的运作。
Because this is information, this is
power, this is what the Internet runs on.

33
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:53.564
例如，几年前， AWS 被关闭了。
For instance,
a couple of years ago AWS went down.

34
00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:57.108
那就是 Amazon Web 服务器，这是世界上最大的主机之一。
So that's Amazon Web Server, that's
one of the biggest hosts in the world.

35
00:01:57.108 --> 00:02:00.186
这就是 Netflix 的用途，很多人使用的东西。
It's what Netflix uses,
what a lot of people use.

36
00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.257
其中一个被关闭了，互联网基本被关闭了。
One of them went down and
the Internet went down essentially.

37
00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:08.014
所以我们把网络想象成这样的分布式计算机
So we think of the Internet as these
distributed computers all around

38
00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:12.195
但我们真正依赖的是主要的数据中心
the world, but we really are relying
on main data centers and

39
00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:15.231
不同的路由网络主干
different routing networks, backbones.

40
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:19.076
就像基础设施的核心部分如果它们下降
There's like core parts of
the infrastructure that if they go down,

41
00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:20.085
我们都被击沉了
we're all sunk.

42
00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:24.472
但我认为最值得注意的是数据中心的有趣之处在于
But I think the most notable thing that
I find interesting about data centers is

43
00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:28.209
他们所消耗的能量是巨大的城市规模巨大
the amount of power they consume
is massive, city scale massive.

44
00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.512
它看起来不像这样但是如果你有这么多
It doesn't look like this, but
if you have all these millions and

45
00:02:31.512 --> 00:02:34.776
数以百万计的岩芯在运转它们会吸引大量的能量
millions of cores running,
they're sucking up a lot of power.

46
00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:38.866
你现在看到的是 Facebook，他们建立了自己的数据中心。
And what you'll see now is Facebook,
they've built their own data centers.

47
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:39.896
谷歌拥有自己的数据中心。
Google has their own data centers.

48
00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:41.600
亚马逊拥有自己的数据中心。
Amazon has their own data centers.

49
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.487
它们都是专门为应用程序构建的专门机器。
And they're all specialized machines
specifically built for their applications.

50
00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:47.408
但他们都做了很多好事
But what a lot of them are doing,
which is good,

51
00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:50.816
他们正在建造这种可再生能源他们正在建造下一个风电场或
is they're building this renewable energy
and they're building next wind farms or

52
00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:52.978
因为它们的能量如此之大
something like that because these eat so
much power.

53
00:02:52.978 --> 00:02:55.876
这完全是数据中心的一个切线。
That's totally a tangent on data centers.

54
00:02:55.876 --> 00:03:00.161
但是，通常，当您收到请求时，它将在某个位置命中数据中心。
But, generally, when you have requests,
it's going to hit a data center somewhere.

55
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.056
有些人喜欢自己的主人
Some people like to host their own.

56
00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.634
我们一会儿再谈一下云。
We'll talk a bit more about
the cloud in a second.

57
00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.675
但要确定它的样子
But will identify what it looks like.

58
00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:09.514
这是免费开放式源代码映像。
This is the free open source image.

59
00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:11.231
谷歌的人就像很厉害
The ones from Google
are like very impressive.

60
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:14.384
他们都是大的建筑
They're much larger buildings.

61
00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:17.206
所以一个数据中心就是这个计算机的集合。
So a data center is just this
collection of computers.

62
00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:20.917
通常，它们在不同应用程序，不同公司之间共享。
Often, they're shared between different
applications, different companies.

63
00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:27.552
很多时候，您可以使用 VPS 租用一台服务器或一小部分服务器。
A lot of times you can rent one server or
a fraction of a server with the VPS.

64
00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:30.448
或者，如果您是一家大公司，那么有时您可以拥有整个数据中心。
Or sometimes you can own an entire data
center if you're a big enough company.

65
00:03:32.987 --> 00:03:34.312
>> Jem Young: 让我们来谈谈云。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
let's talk about the cloud.

66
00:03:34.312 --> 00:03:38.381
数据中心对计算机和
Data centers are newer
thinking about computers and

67
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:45.515
数据中心实际上是一个相当现代的发明，我说 15 年， 20 年。
data centers are actually fairly modern
invention, I say fairly, say 15, 20 years.

68
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:49.716
以前想跑个网站什么的，我就有一台电脑的
Before if I wanted to run a website or
host anything, I had a rack of computers

69
00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:53.263
坐在这里如果有人说服务器停机了
sitting here and literally if
someone says the server's down,

70
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.248
我得把它插进去
I had to go plug it back in like that.

71
00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:57.052
这是服务器用来工作的方式。
That was the way servers used to work.

72
00:03:57.052 --> 00:04:00.729
然后人们说，嗯，那是一个 hassle，服务器贵，
Then people said, yeah,
that's a hassle, servers are expensive,

73
00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.490
硬件就能过时了
the hardware can get out of date.

74
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.638
如何将服务器关闭而不将所有内容都记下 ?
How do you take a server down
without taking everything down?

75
00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.840
所以我们有一个数据中心，所以其他人可以回答
So we have the single data center so
someone else can answer someone

76
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.091
现在的问题是，专门从事硬件工作的人。
else's problem at this point, people that
are specialized in working with hardware.

77
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.288
还有关于云计算的伟大之处
And the great thing about
cloud computing and

78
00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:20.584
数据中心可以位于地球的不同部分。
data centers is they can be in
different parts of the planet.

79
00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:24.490
所以如果我现在在主持这个视频，在我的笔记本电脑上，
So if I were hosting this video right now,
this course on my laptop,

80
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.475
当我去吃午饭或关闭我的电脑时，一切都在下降。
the minute I go to lunch or
close my computer, everything goes down.

81
00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:29.579
这不太好
That's not good.

82
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:34.316
还有，如果你在说，格陵兰岛，是的，如果你是这样的话，
And also, if you're in say, Greenland,
yeah, if you're in like, say,

83
00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:37.432
格陵兰岛，我不认为它是大规模的。
Greenland, I don't think
it's massive scale.

84
00:04:37.432 --> 00:04:40.939
我现在开始质疑这个标志了
I'm starting to question this logo now,
but

85
00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.269
让我们说你在伦敦
let's say you're in London about there.

86
00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:46.252
我们要花很多时间才能到这里
It's gonna take a lot of
hops to get over here.

87
00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:49.074
那为什么没有一个数据中心呢，我不知道，
So why not have a data center in,
I don't know,

88
00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:51.771
非洲要走得更近一点
Africa which is gonna
be a little bit closer.

89
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:53.653
你不用在大西洋上跳下来
You don't have to make
the hop across the Atlantic.

90
00:04:53.653 --> 00:04:55.465
这会更快一些
It's gonna be a little bit faster.

91
00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:57.391
这就是云的优势
And that's the advantage of the cloud,

92
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:01.196
就是我可以在世界的不同地方都有同样的应用
is that I can have the same application
running in different parts of the world.

93
00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.326
而且它会更快一点
And it's gonna be a little bit faster and

94
00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:06.596
如果你再靠近点你就能减少这方面的差距了
you're gonna reduce that lag
if you're a little bit closer.

95
00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:09.596
还记得我们之前是怎么跑的
Remember how we ran trace route
earlier and it did all those hops.

96
00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:13.375
您通常需要最少的跳数，因为每个中继段都是
You generally want the least number of
hops because every hop is the chance for

97
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:17.625
有些东西出了问题或者只是速度较慢因为还有纳秒
something to go wrong or it's just slower
because there's still nanoseconds it takes

98
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:21.427
进行切换以拦截请求并切换到下一个和下一个。
for a switch to intercept a request and
switch to the next one and the next one.

99
00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:28.514
但关于云的伟大之处在于弹性计算的概念。
But the great thing about the cloud
is this idea of elastic computing.

100
00:05:28.514 --> 00:05:29.547
什么是弹性计算?
What is elastic computing?

101
00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:33.029
虽然听起来很像但你可能听到了很多话
It's kind of what it sounds like but,
and you probably hear the phrase a lot,

102
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.274
你都觉得是什么
what do you all think it is?

103
00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:38.538
>> Jem Young: 有人吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Anybody?

104
00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.463
>> 扬声器 2: 按需要进行缩放( 如需要 ) 或-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it scaling,
like as needed or-

105
00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:42.600
>> Jem Young: 对，对， Sam.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, exactly right, Sam.

106
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.156
对就是这样
Yeah, exactly.

107
00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:46.067
听起来就像这样
It's what it sounds like.

108
00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:47.995
它是弹性的
It's, it's elastic.

109
00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:49.572
那真是太好了
What's great about that is and

110
00:05:49.572 --> 00:05:53.281
为什么数据中心在云中很棒是很棒的，我是马克 - 乌尔班斯基。
why data centers are great in the cloud
is great is I am I am Mark Urbanski.

111
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.754
我是大公司的首席执行官 Frontend Masters.com
I am big,
powerful CEO Frontend Masters.com,

112
00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:59.223
我交通很繁忙
and I'm getting a lot of traffic.

113
00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:00.290
这是缩放比例缩放。
It's scaling scaling.

114
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.821
以前我要做的就是买更多的服务器，
In the old days, what I had to do
was I had to buy more servers and

115
00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:03.913
我得买更多的服务器
I had to buy more servers.

116
00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:07.238
但是如果你有一个数据中心我们可以出租，我们就可以说，哎，
But if you have a data center we can
rent out, we can just say like, hey,

117
00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.084
我需要再分配三个服务器。
I need to allocate three more servers.

118
00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:10.266
好吧好吧
All right, cool.

119
00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:11.143
按钮
Hit a button.

120
00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:12.161
好了
Done.

121
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:15.502
我需要缩小范围，因为这是圣诞时间，人们不学习。
I need to scale down because it's
Christmas time and people don't study.

122
00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:17.654
他们不会在圣诞或其他地方做 Fronend Masters 。
They don't do Frontend Masters
over Christmas or something.

123
00:06:17.654 --> 00:06:19.069
我们可以把它放大缩小
We can just scale that back down.

124
00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.495
所以我们的成本可以随流量调整而不是定在一定程度上
So our costs can adjust with the traffic
rather than us being fixed with a certain

125
00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:27.740
我们要支付的硬件，维护之类的。
set of hardware that we're paying for,
maintaining and things like that.

126
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.312
你听到了很多弹性云计算的说法，这就是所谓的。
You hear the phrase a lot elastic cloud
computing that's what that's referring to.

127
00:06:31.312 --> 00:06:34.478
例如，真实的生命示例 Netflix，
For instance, real life example, Netflix,

128
00:06:34.478 --> 00:06:37.571
我们每年最忙的一次是圣诞节
one of our busiest times
a year is Christmas.

129
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:40.288
人们是家庭的家，你知道人们对家庭做什么，
People are home to families and you
know what people do with their families,

130
00:06:40.288 --> 00:06:41.485
他们不想和他们说话
they don't want to talk to them.

131
00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:42.129
他们不会挂的
They don't hang out.

132
00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:46.168
所以他们都在看 Netflix 在他们手机里做什么
So they're all watching Netflix in
their room on their phones doing what

133
00:06:46.168 --> 00:06:46.968
家人都这样
families do.

134
00:06:46.968 --> 00:06:50.413
所以这是我们今年最忙的时候
So, it's one of our busiest
times of the year, so

135
00:06:50.413 --> 00:06:53.620
我们所做的是我们能设定更高的限度
what we do is we can set
the limits much higher.

136
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.874
我们只是放大我们的服务器
We just scale up our servers.

137
00:06:54.874 --> 00:06:57.497
所以我们就放大所有服务器来处理这个额外的流量。
So we just scale up all our servers
to handle this additional traffic.

138
00:06:57.497 --> 00:07:00.475
一旦交通开始下降，我们就把它缩小。
And then once traffic starts to ramp down,
we just scale this back down.

139
00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:03.824
因此，我们不需要支付这些我们不需要的未使用的计算循环。
So we're not paying for this unused
compute cycles that we don't need.

140
00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:07.999
这真的很强大，这在计算世界上是个全新的想法。
That's really powerful and that's a really
new idea in the world of computing.

141
00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:13.005
就像我们需要的那样，在需求能力上。
It's just like this on
demand capacity as we need.

142
00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:16.836
但是老实说大多数人和大多数人都在看这个
But, honestly, most of you,
and most people watching this,

143
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:20.098
你永远都不需要有服务器的数据中心了
you're never gonna need
a data center with a server.

144
00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:24.432
如果你做得好你会杀了它
If you do, nice job, you are killing it.

145
00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:28.483
如果你需要一个完整的数据中心，但是大多数人，
You're doing really great if you need
an entire data center, but most people,

146
00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:31.036
我们只需要一小部分服务器
we just need a tiny little
fraction of one server.

147
00:07:31.036 --> 00:07:34.735
因为记得我说的服务器有五六十个内核，
Because remember how I said
servers have 50, 60 hundred cores,

148
00:07:34.735 --> 00:07:38.178
其实不知道是什么限制，大概是挺高的，
actually don't know what the limit is,
probably pretty high,

149
00:07:38.178 --> 00:07:41.331
可能在超级计算机上成千上万的人
probably in the thousands for
you at the supercomputers.

150
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:41.933
有人知道吗
Anybody know?

151
00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:43.687
这不重要
It's not important.

152
00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:48.180
但我们需要的是，我们只需要一小部分的服务器。
But what we need is we just probably need
a fraction of a fraction of a server.

153
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.220
我们今天要创建的服务器在一台服务器上是一个核心
And the server we're gonna create today
is gonna be one core on one server,

154
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.889
就像是一小部分服务器的一小部分
which is just like a fraction of
a fraction of a fraction of a server.

155
00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:58.798
因为这就是我们所需要的，为什么我们不需要付出代价呢 ?
Because that's all we need, and
why pay for things we don't need?

156
00:07:58.798 --> 00:08:03.108
这就是云计算背后的理念
And that's the idea behind cloud
computing in this capacity,

157
00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.232
你只需要付出代价
you just pay for what you need.

158
00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:09.639
我们要做的是做一个服务器，把它切成小块，
So what we do is we take a server,
we just slice it into little chunks and

159
00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:12.199
这些组块无法相互交流
these chunks can't talk to each other.

160
00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:15.838
有一个过程隔离的想法
There's this idea of process isolation,

161
00:08:15.838 --> 00:08:19.887
这就是你在运营我的网站 party.com
which is you're running
I like to party.com.

162
00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:21.658
不知道请不要去
Don't know please don't go there.

163
00:08:21.658 --> 00:08:25.300
我不知道该网站是什么样的，我不承担这个责任。
I don't know what that website is like,
I take no responsibility for that.

164
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.228
但我想运行 Jovian.com 我们可以在同一台服务器上运行
But I wanna run Jovian.com,
we can run on the same server and

165
00:08:28.228 --> 00:08:31.228
我们甚至都不知道那是什么
we don't even know that either,
and we just ran what we need.

166
00:08:31.228 --> 00:08:35.953
这是一个非常有力的想法，我认为是完全低估的。
And that's a really powerful idea
that I think is totally underrated.

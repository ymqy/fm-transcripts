这就是互联网我们遵循的规则

If I type in all caps, that means I'm
yelling, if I do a /s, that means sarcasm.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.310
任何类似的事情

But if you're curious, you can go
to maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo, and

>> Jem Young: 说实话，我觉得他们都不愿意
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Honestly, I think it's
pretty brazen that they're not even gonna

26
00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.569
隐藏他们的 IP 地址，因为他们不知道要做什么。
hide their IP address because they know
nothing's going to be done about it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
> > Jem Young: 但我对 twitter.com 做了 ping 操作，我没有 ping IP 地址。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But I pinged twitter.com,
and I didn't ping an IP address.

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.160
而工作方式是另一套协议，有很多协议。
And the way that works is another set of
protocols, there's a lot of protocols.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.080
当你看着互联网和那些运行互联网的人
When you look at the Internet and
the people that run the Internet and

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.980
有一些人运行因特网或运行交换机和连接，以及
there are people that run the Internet or
run the switches and connections and

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.300
骨子里
backbones.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.559
再一次，这是一个信任系统，其中一个是 DNS 系统。
Again, it's this trust system and
one of those things is the DNS system.

7
00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:28.570
DNS 被我想说是 ICANN 因特网我忘了 ICANN 的代表了
DNS is run by I wanna say it's ICANN
Internet, I forgot what ICANN stands for.

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.260
它代表什么，不要担心，而是控制域名。
It stands for something, don't worry,
but they control domain names.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.539
当您购买域名时，实际支付一小部分费用 $ 0.60 或
When you buy domain name, you actually
pay a little bit of fee $0.60 or

10
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.289
也许更不适用于 ICANN ，他们帮助创建这个域名系统。
maybe more maybe less to ICANN and
they help create this domain name system.

11
00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.240
而它只是一个互联网电话簿。
And what it is is just,
it's an Internet phone book.

12
00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.409
但这太简单了
But that's oversimplifying it.

13
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.549
其实是一个智能的网上电话簿，就说哎，
It's actually an intelligent
Internet phone book, just says hey,

14
00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.130
我想去 twitter.com
I want to go to twitter.com.

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.390
它不一定直接把你路由到旧金山的服务器上
It's not necessarily routing you
directly to the servers in San Francisco

16
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.229
因为那样会很缓慢
because that would be really slow.

17
00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.950
世界上到处都有数据中心
There's things called data
centers all around the world,

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.600
记录在第二个记录中
which is documented in a second.

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.180
但 DNS 说，这个解决的最接近的服务器是什么 ?
But DNS says, what's the closest
server that this resolves to?

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.319
所以它所做的就是将域名映射到 IP 地址。
So all it does is it maps
domain names to IP addresses.

21
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.599
我们需要他们因为我不记得自己的 IP 地址
And we need them because I can't
remember my own IP address,

22
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:15.289
我记不起任何人的 IP 地址我几乎不记得自己的电话号码了
I can't remember anybody's IP address,
I can barely remember my own phone number.

23
00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.939
DNS 系统
The DNS system,

24
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.400
你可能已经听说过了，因为这就是互联网的运作方式。
you've probably heard of it because again,
this is how the Internet works.

25
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.620
这就是它如何进入的。
This is how it became accessible.

26
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.680
我们并不都是用电视和电视
We're not all using shells and
using telnet and

27
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.200
所有这些命令行工具下载 Web 页面，我们使用的是 GUIs。
all these command line tools to
download web pages, we're using GUIs.

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.549
域名系统只是让更多人使用互联网的一种方式。
Domain name system is just a way of making
the Internet accessible for more people.

29
00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.469
你可能都看见了吧
And you probably all see or
not you probably,

30
00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.567
我保证你见过域和领域像是 frontendmasters.com
I guarantee you've seen domains and domain
is something like frontendmasters.com,

31
00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.159
jemyoung.com 这叫你的域名
jemyoung.com, that's called your domain.

32
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.530
点 com点 biz 点网点点
The dot com, dot biz,
dot net, dot anything,

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.879
这是顶级域名，是 TLD。
that's the top level domain, it's the TLD.

34
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.180
TLD 由特定公司，实体或国家或地区拥有。
TLDs are owned by specific companies,
entities or countries.

35
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.879
你知道我最不喜欢的 TLD 是什么吗
You know what my least favorite TLD is?

36
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.439
多特别 你知道的， bot -i-z.
Dot biz.
You know, dot b-i-z.

37
00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.989
就好像我看到了点东西
It just seems like if I
see something dot biz,

38
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.610
无意冒犯任何有点 biz TLD 的人它就像是一个骗局
no offense to anybody with a dot biz TLD,
it just seems like a scam.

39
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.879
如果是点 biz 就像 wow.
If it's dot biz, it's like wow.

40
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.284
有个 [INAUDIBLE] 想给你钱而不是点 biz
There's an [INAUDIBLE] that wants
to give money instead of dot biz.

41
00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:16.879
哇不我开玩笑的
Wow, no, I'm kidding.

42
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.126
我真的不别用点 biz
I'm really not, don't use dot biz.

43
00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:22.460
在这几年里如果你没注意到
And over the years,
if you haven't noticed,

44
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.088
所有好的点 coms 都是用的，不一定是真的。
all the good dot coms are taken,
which is not necessarily true.

45
00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:29.123
你只需要得到真正的创造力
You just have to get really,
really creative.

46
00:02:29.123 --> 00:02:31.906
还记得几年前的那个阶段吗
Remember that phase a couple
of years ago with the dot lys?

47
00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:38.192
就像闪动的，迅速的，就像新的一样，像点 li一样。
It was like bitly, fastly, that was
like the hot new thing, like the dot li.

48
00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:41.469
我想在某个国家的某个地方说点歌词
I want to say dot lyzone
by some country somewhere.

49
00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.849
我不记得了你可以查清楚
I don't remember, you can look it up.

50
00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.099
有点里奥真的很贵
There's dot io, which is really expensive.

51
00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.699
我想说拥有这个国家的密克罗尼西亚
I wanna say it's Micronesia
that owns that country, but

52
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.430
几乎每个国家都有自己的顶级域名
almost every country has
their own top level domain.

53
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.897
所以你可以再次说 dmx.ru
So you can say, again, dmx.ru,

54
00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:58.692
dmx 是俄罗斯的谷歌，点 ru 是俄罗斯， cn 是中国。
dmx is the Google of Russia,
dot ru is Russia, cn is China.

55
00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:02.969
但在很大程度上，点 com 仍然是真正的
But largely dot com is still
kind of the domain that really

56
00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.018
因为它是 OG 域，第一个域，或者是其中一个原始域。
wants to have because it's the OG domains,
the first one, or one of the originals.

57
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:10.399
这里有点网，有点组织，但通常是点 orgs，
There's also.dot net, there's dot org,
but generally dot orgs,

58
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.950
它以前是你得不到非盈利性的
it used to be you couldn't get one
without being like a nonprofit status or

59
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.864
或者大学之类的
something like that, or university.

60
00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:19.679
但是他们加了点小点你的很多学院
But they since added dot edu,
which a lot of your colleges or

61
00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.849
大学，就像有个点点。
universities, things
like that have a dot edu.

62
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.389
但现在有一大堆顶级域名因为公司很不错
But now there's a whole bunch of top level
domains, because companies are like well,

63
00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.840
我怎么无法拥有自己的 TLD 和我的 CANN
how come I can't have my own TLD and
I CANNs like, okay,

64
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.610
我们会为你做些新的
we'll make some new ones for you.

65
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.698
现在，在谷歌的网站上，有点杰夫，有点派对，
So now there's dot Google there's dot dev,
there's dot party,

66
00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:38.639
我最喜欢的域名
my favorite domain name.

67
00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.699
只有很多顶级域
Just lots of top level domains, so

68
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.354
好的是如果你今天需要一个网站而你没有
the good thing is if you need a website
today and you don't have one.

69
00:03:43.354 --> 00:03:46.792
你会在一天结束的时候有一个，但是你也可以用任何的 TLD
You're gonna have one by the end of the
day but also you could use whatever TLD

70
00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:50.620
除了点 biz 之外，我告诉你别用点 biz ，这是个坏主意。
you want except for dot biz, I'm telling
you don't use dot biz, this is a bad idea.

71
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.199
子域将是博客或测试或 dev 点。
A subdomain would be the blog or
tests or dev dot something.

72
00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.432
这就是所谓的亚域。
That's what's known as a sub domain.

73
00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:59.650
这就意味着它仍会路由到主域，但是
And that just means it still
routes to the main domain, but

74
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.560
这可能只是现场的另一个部分
it's just probably
a different part of the site.

75
00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.146
现在，是否有人告诉我为什么要使用子域与路径?
Now, can anybody tell me why I would
use a sub domain versus a path?

76
00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:10.931
而一条路径是真正的 com 斜杠，或者关于我或我
And a path would be genuine com
slash about or about who am I or

77
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:12.860
就像这样
something like that.

78
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.960
好的萨姆
Yes, Sam.

79
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.439
>> 扬声器 2: 如果要有多个实际的独立服务器。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you want to have
more than one actual separate server.

80
00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.435
>> Jem Young: 对，对。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, exactly, right.

81
00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:24.091
>> 扬声器 2: 它允许您更有效地阻止数据交叉
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It allows you to partition
your data more effectively prevents cross

82
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:26.540
站点脚本编制之类的
site scripting, stuff like that.

83
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.389
> > Jem Young: 是的，你的想法非常好。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
you're thinking at a really good level.

84
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:32.209
对于用户，子域，它仅表示，
For users, the subdomain,
it just indicates,

85
00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.740
它是一个不同的地点
it's a different site generally.

86
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.470
因此 blog.jemyoung.com 与 jemyoung.com 完全不同。
So blog.jemyoung.com looks completely
different from jemyoung.com.

87
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.887
我不是在 pimping 我自己的网站，很穷，我不坚持，
And I'm not pimping my own website,
it's pretty poor, I don't maintain it,

88
00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:42.908
我觉得它在跑
I think it's running.

89
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:45.909
我甚至不知道是否有一半的时间因为你知道
I don't even know if it's running
half the time because you know.

90
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.269
> 演讲者 3: 它正在运行，但是你的最后一个岗位是 5 年前的。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's running but
your last post was five years ago.

91
00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:49.345
> > Jem Young: 是的，别对我说
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, don't judge me.

92
00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:49.850
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Jem Young: 不要法官。
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Don't judge me.

93
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.355
>> 演讲者 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

94
00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:51.024
>> Jem Young: 我以为这是
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I thought this was

95
00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.449
一个判断自由的区域
a judgment free zone.

96
00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.560
我想，我要成为互联网名，开始做部落格。
I thought hey, I'm going to become
internet famous and start doing a blog.

97
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.350
然后我就跑出来了我不记得我的最后一个职位是
And then I ran out of steam really fast of
off that, I don't remember my last post is

98
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.470
可能是很重要的事
on probably hashing or
something like that so important.

99
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.439
但它只告诉用户你在这个网站的完全不同部分
But it just tells the user that you're at
a completely different part of the site,

100
00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.569
它和这个网站的关联，但是它可能完全是一个不同的应用。
and its affiliated with the site, but it's
probably a different application entirely.

101
00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.439
第一条路， blog.jemyoung.com 是，是，你是
First the path, blog.jemyoung.com slash
about, which is yeah, you're part of

102
00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.970
网站和你就在不同的路径上，在主网站上是不同的页面。
the site and you're just on a different
route, a different page on the main site.

103
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.699
而由于 DNS 系统，我可以映射 jemyoung.com 。
And because of DNS system,
I can map jemyoung.com, the 23.23.185.61.

104
00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.944
所以别忘了每次我都能把它输入
So rather than remember that every
single time, I can just type that in and

105
00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:34.939
DNS 解析程序会发现的
the DNS resolvers figure that out.

106
00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:35.909
他们怎么想出来的
How do they figure that out?

107
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.370
更多服务器。
More servers.

108
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.620
有很多服务器。
There are a lot of servers.

109
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.240
因特网建立在服务器，信任和节点以及类似的东西上。
The Internet is built on servers and
trusts and nodes and things like that.

110
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.896
但有一个叫名称服务器的想法。
But there's idea called a name server.

111
00:05:45.896 --> 00:05:50.069
名称服务器是保留该映射的实际实体。
And the name server is the actual
entity that keeps that mapping.

112
00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.867
因此，每当您从我们的 Web 主机购买新域时，请使用名称羊或
So whenever you buy a new domain
from our web host, so name sheep or

113
00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:56.860
去爸爸或者谷歌还有一个大的
Go Daddy or Google and
one of the big ones.

114
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.840
他们都有名字的服务器
They all have name servers.

115
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.759
就这样说，这个人刚刚买了这个域名。
And that just says hey,
this person just bought this domain.

116
00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.269
而且可能哪儿也不去
And it's probably not going anywhere.

117
00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.529
但如果你需要查清楚我就知道那是什么地方
But if you need to look it up,
I know exactly where that is.

118
00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.209
实际上，我将会用分组的方式来谈论这个问题。
And actually, I'll talk about
that a second with packets.

119
00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:11.439
但名字是我们可能不知道的
But names are the thing that
we probably don't know exist.

120
00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.860
我们今天要修改一下因为我们要用它来说明
We're going to modify one today just
because we're going to use it to point

121
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.819
从我们的主机到我们的服务器
from our hosts to our
server at some point.

122
00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.290
但知道这些名字服务器的存在是件好事。
But it's good to know
that name servers exists.

123
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.040
他们本质上是网络的记录员
They essentially Are they the record
keepers of the internet if you're trying

124
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.850
以输入域名
to type them domain name

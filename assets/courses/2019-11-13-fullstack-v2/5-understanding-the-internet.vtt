00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:04.410
>> Jem Young: 互联网工作方式如何 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: How does the Internet work?

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.405
有人捅了它不是萨姆
Someone take a stab at it, not Sam.

3
00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:10.544
还有谁
Anybody else?

4
00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.871
抛出答案。
Throw out an answer.

5
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:13.622
这是我最喜欢的面试问题之一。
This is one of my favorite
interview questions.

6
00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:18.487
我不经常问，但它是其中之一，你能理解什么 ?
I don't ask it that often, but
it's one of those, what do you understand?

7
00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:21.602
你的知识在哪里，在前端是后端，
Where's your knowledge lies,
at the front end, is it the back end,

8
00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:23.280
是联网的地方吗
is it networking, is it somewhere?

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.859
如果你是工程师你的理解就在某个地方
If you're an engineer,
your understanding lies somewhere.

10
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.606
除非你是我不知道是个自驾的汽车工程师
Unless you're like, I don't know,
a self-driving car engineer or

11
00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:34.128
一个桥梁建筑工程师，好的，有很多不同类型的工程师。
a bridge building engineer, okay, there's
lots of different types of engineer.

12
00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:37.213
但如果你是一个在网络上工作的软件工程师
But if you're a software
engineer that works on the web,

13
00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:41.466
最重要的是软件工程师，你至少应该知道其中的一部分。
which is most software engineers, you
should know at least some part of this.

14
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.970
那么，互联网是如何运作的呢 ?
So how does the Internet work?

15
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.225
有人吗 什么都扔了
Anybody?
Just throw out anything.

16
00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:45.171
没有错误的答案。
There are no wrong answers.

17
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.404
我们今天都在学习
We're all learning here today.

18
00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:49.963
>> 扬声器 2: 一群计算机相互交谈。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A bunch of
computers talking to each other.

19
00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:51.146
> > Jem Young: 对我来说足够了。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Good enough for me.

20
00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:53.520
是啊是一堆电脑在交谈
Yeah, it's a bunch of computers
talking to each other.

21
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.781
那么，互联网是如何运作的呢 ?
So how does the Internet work, though?

22
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.131
这就是互联网的内容。
That's kinda what the Internet is.

23
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.926
>> 扬声器 2: 请求和响应的批次，对吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Lots of requests and
responses, right?

24
00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.527
> > Jem Young: 是的，是的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:09.977
>> Jem Young: 是的，很多要求和回应，对我也有好处。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, lots of requests and
responses, that's good for me, too.

26
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:12.576
>> 扬声器 3: 我只知道有文件和
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just
know there's files and

27
00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:18.090
信息包被传递到不同的领域我不知道
packets of files get passed
across different, I don't know.

28
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.748
>> Jem Young: 是的，有时是文件，包和计算机。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, sometimes it's files,
packets, computers.

29
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.968
我认为我们认为互联网的很多东西是我们想到的网页浏览器，
I think a lot of what we think of the
Internet is we think of web browsers, and

30
00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:30.323
我们想，我不知道，可能是流式电影之类的。
we think of, I don't know, maybe
streaming movies or something like that.

31
00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:34.777
人们与互联网互动的主要原因是万维网，
Mostly what people interact with
the Internet is the World Wide Web,

32
00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:36.864
那就是 www 点的点
that's the www dot something.

33
00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.475
我们都知道但是
We all know that, but

34
00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:42.966
我保证我的未来儿子不知道 www 代表什么
I guarantee my future son will
not know what www stands for.

35
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.668
只是当你输入的时候，但那是万维网，
It's just that when you type in,
but that's the World Wide Web,

36
00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.204
那只是互联网的一部分
that's just a part of the Internet.

37
00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:50.941
还有 FTP 网络上运行的东西
There's still FTP,
there's things that run over the Internet,

38
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:54.224
所以有些东西像 BitTorrent 或者电影串流
so there's things like a BitTorrent or
movie streaming.

39
00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:59.400
有很多其他的例子，但是大多数人，对，马克。
There's lots of other examples,
but most people, yes, Mark.

40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.487
>演讲者 4: Andrew Online 说这是一系列的管道。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Andrew Online
says it's a series of tubes.

41
00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:04.840
>> 演讲者 3: [LAUGH] >> Jem Young:
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That was the answer I was

42
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.915
其实是在找
actually looking for.

43
00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:07.381
他们会在第二次被雇用
They would be hired in a second.

44
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.667
它是一系列的管子。
It is a series of tubes.

45
00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.231
但就像每个网站都是一系列的请求
But like every site,
it's a series of requests and

46
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:14.287
不同设备的响应只是相互对话。
responses by different devices
just talking to each other.

47
00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:17.824
所以我想用最简单的定义
So I use the simplest definition
I could think of, and

48
00:02:17.824 --> 00:02:21.139
我没查过这个尽管我可以
I didn't look this up,
even though I could have.

49
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.566
我只是说这是一系列全球互联互通的设备。
I just said it's a series of
globally interconnected devices.

50
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:30.056
我会说这是一系列公开互联的设备。
And I'll say it's a series of
publicly interconnected devices.

51
00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:32.115
那是网络我们都知道
That's the Internet,
that's the thing we all know,

52
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:33.651
这就是我们现在所使用的
it's the thing we're using right now.

53
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.906
这就是你在家中的经历和流
Thing that is running through and
streaming to you at home,

54
00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.151
你在教室里
you in the classroom.

55
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:41.141
这跟内部网有点不同
That's a little different
from the intranet.

56
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.862
内部网就像互联网，但它是私人的。
The intranet is like the Internet,
but it's private.

57
00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:48.971
有多少人使用 VPN，虚拟专用网，用于工作?
How many people use a VPN,
a Virtual Private Network, for work?

58
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:49.832
是的大部分公司都这么做
Yeah, most companies do.

59
00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:51.033
这是最佳做法之一。
It's one of the best practices.

60
00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:53.835
所以如果你在 VPN 上，你就在网上。
So if you're on a VPN,
you're on an intranet.

61
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:57.026
这只是不同服务器之间相互对话的私人互联网
Which is just a private Internet of
different servers talking to each other,

62
00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:58.805
但外面是不可能的
but it's inaccessible from the outside.

63
00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.247
为什么这很重要
Why is that important?

64
00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.610
在某个时候你可能会听到 " 冥顽不化 " 一词
At some point,
you may hear the term intranets,

65
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.885
你可能会听到广域网广域网的情况很相似
you may hear the term WAN wide
area network, pretty similar.

66
00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:11.133
局域网才是这个教室的网络。
Local area network would be
Internet just for this classroom.

67
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:13.978
所以如果我有服务器运行，实际上有服务器在那边运行，
So if I had a server running, actually
there are server's running over there,

68
00:03:13.978 --> 00:03:16.413
有一个服务器在那边运行，而且它是唯一可以访问的。
there's a server running over there,
and it was only accessible.

69
00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:18.639
这将是一个局域网，不能从外部进入。
That would be a local area network,
that is not accessible from the outside.

00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.052
>> Jem: 为何完整堆栈?
&gt;&gt; Jem: And why full stack?

2
00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:05.668
我知道，我确实在对什么是完整的栈进行了骚扰，并且在这个定义上。
I know, I'm really harping on what is
full stack, and going on this definition.

3
00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:09.156
因为如果你说你是个完整的工程师
Because again,
if you say you're a full stack engineer,

4
00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:12.654
有些人是这样的人不是真实的
there are people that are like,
that's not a real thing.

5
00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:17.695
当我听到满满的时候，或者我得到很多招聘者，
And when I hear full stack, or
I get a lot of recruiters reach out and

6
00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:20.850
说我需要一个完整的堆工程师
say, hey, I need a full stack engineer.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.236
我想他们想要一个黑客[ LAUGH]
What I think is they want a hacker,
[LAUGH] but

8
00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.050
他们不知道他们需要什么
they don't know what they need.

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.974
所以他们说我想要一个擅长什么的人因为我们会知道
So they say, I want someone who's good at
everything because we'll figure out what

10
00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.251
你需要的时候才需要
you need when you get here.

11
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:33.627
如果你想去的话也可以
That's okay too if that's
kind of where you wanna go.

12
00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.131
我开始做满堆的
I started doing full stack.

13
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:39.552
我开始在 PHP 工作， PHP 可以考虑一个通用的
I started working in PHP, which PHP
you can consider one of the universal

14
00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:44.061
您可以在后端中编码的语言，您可以在前端进行编码。
languages that you can code in
the backend, you can code in the frontend.

15
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:45.276
其实不是不好的语言。
It's actually not a bad language.

16
00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:49.768
它有很多的 flack ，但我认为是低估了。
It gets a lot of flack,
but underrated I think.

17
00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:52.726
但你在职业生涯的某个时候就满身了
But you went full stack because
at some point in your career,

18
00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:54.530
你会看到这些东西的
you're gonna see all these things.

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.490
我们今天来的所有概念如果你要做 10年的工程师
All the concepts we come over today,
if you're gonna be an engineer for 10, 15,

20
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.356
二十，不管你想做工程师多久，都能看到这些东西。
20, however long you wanna be an engineer,
you're gonna see all these things.

21
00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.798
我想让你熟悉他们
And I want you to be familiar with them.

22
00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:05.162
这就是它的真实情况。
And that's really what it's about.

23
00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:08.948
老实说我现在就告诉你这只是我们之间的
And honestly, I'll tell you now,
and it's just between us and

24
00:01:08.948 --> 00:01:13.240
互联网上有些陌生的陌生人，有很多 UI 工程师。
some random strangers on the Internet,
there's a lot of UI engineers.

25
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.271
UI 工程可能是一个很容易进入的领域
UI engineering is probably one
of the easy fields to get into,

26
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:19.206
因为您只需打开浏览器，就可以开始进行编码。
because you can just open up browser and
just start coding.

27
00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:20.067
那就好
And that's good.

28
00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:21.930
每个人都应该像个工程师
Everybody should think like an engineer.

29
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.546
不是每个人都是
Well, not everybody, but

30
00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:28.263
大家都应该明白这个世界是如何运作的，这个技术是如何运作的。
everybody should understand how the world
works, how this technology works.

31
00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:31.846
但如果你想区分自己理解完整的堆栈
But if you wanna differentiate yourself,
understanding full stack,

32
00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:35.795
了解它是如何走到一起的，会使你成为一个更好的工程师。
understanding how it all comes together,
will make you the better engineer.

33
00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:40.390
在世界上所有 UI 工程师中，即使你不做任何事情
Amongst all the UI engineers in the world,
even if you don't do any of the stuff ever

34
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.225
再一次知道你是个更好的工程师
again, just knowing makes
you a better engineer.

35
00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:44.405
我可以这么说
That much I can say that.

36
00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.881
这就是为什么我喜欢这样做，因为它很有帮助。
And that's why I like to do this course,
because it's just so helpful.

37
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:50.963
这对我的事业很有帮助，因为你永远不知道自己要做什么。
It's been so helpful in my career because
you never know what you have to do.

38
00:01:50.963 --> 00:01:54.775
实际上， >> Jem: 在 Netflix 我以前
In fact,
&gt;&gt; Jem: At Netflix I used to,

39
00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:57.206
好吧，我还是做，但是我以前是个 IC ，所以
well, I still do, but
I used to be an IC, so

40
00:01:57.206 --> 00:02:00.403
是主队的个人投稿人
that's individual contributor
on the frontend team.

41
00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:02.055
我在非会员那边工作
I worked on the non-member side.

42
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.414
所以如果你去 netflix.com 或者在电视上，
So if you go to netflix.com or
on the TV, any of that stuff,

43
00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:07.240
那是我工作的领域
that's the domain I worked in.

44
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.329
所以如果你不登录，那就是我的团队。
So if you're not logged in,
that's my team.

45
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.319
但我做的就是做了很多 A/B 测试
But what I did was I
built a lot of A/B tests.

46
00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.074
所以我们不断地测试事物。
So we test things constantly.

47
00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:18.049
但现在我离开了
But now I moved away from that.

48
00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.168
现在我在我们的一个核心小组工作。
Now I work on one of our core teams.

49
00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:23.824
因此，它位于 UI 部分之间。
So that sits between the UI section.

50
00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:27.620
它坐在一个平台层之间。
And it sits between kind
of the platform layer.

51
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.478
我在中间工作
I work in between there.

52
00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:30.092
主要在节点上，就像这样。
So primarily on Node, things like that.

53
00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:35.795
>> Jem: 上周我花了所有时间做了一个 [LAUGH] 数据库迁移，
&gt;&gt; Jem: I've spent all of last week
doing a [LAUGH] database migration,

54
00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.790
因为我选择了 Redis 来建立一个服务现在我要搬去 MySQL了
because I chose Redis to build
a service and I'm now moving to MySQL.

55
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.775
我得把这些都挂了
And I've had to hook these all up.

56
00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:42.991
负载均衡器有问题。
I had a problem with the load balancer.

57
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.341
某些安全许可权不正确。
Some of the security
permissions were incorrect.

58
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:47.509
我得帮你修好
I had to fix the caching.

59
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.265
让我说我不详细说明
Let me just say,
I won't go into details, but

60
00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:52.485
我必须做很多事情需要我去了解到底发生了什么
I had to do a lot of things that required
me to understand exactly what's happening.

61
00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:56.939
如果我说我只是个 UI 工程师那我就知道该怎么做了
And if I said, I'm just the UI engineer,
that's I'll know what to do,

62
00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.997
我不会走很远的
I would not have gotten very far.

63
00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:01.054
再次成为一个完整的工程师和工程师
So again, being a full stack engineer and

64
00:03:01.054 --> 00:03:03.766
了解这些东西是非常有价值的
understanding these things
is incredibly valuable.

65
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.290
我不是说因为你坐在那儿看这个课程
And I'm not just saying that because
you're sitting there watching this course,

66
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.218
我这么说是因为我真的相信
I'm saying it because
I truly believe that.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.000
他们的不同之处，这既有相似之处，也有不同之处，但是
their differences, this is both similarities and differences, but

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.509
特别是差异，我发现这篇特别的文章非常有帮助。
especially differences, I found this particular article to be very helpful.

4
00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.525
他们基本上肩并肩地完成了两个项目，

一大串不同的特征和

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.789
在哪里他们是相同的，在哪里他们是不同的。
where they are the same, same, same, same, and the places where they are different.

7
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.420
这是一篇很好的文章，所以我建议你去看看。
It's a good article, so I'd recommend checking it out.

In summary, what I would say is that TypeScript and flow are very useful in

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.609
很多人发现它们对解决他们的打字问题很有帮助，
that a lot of people are finding them to be helpful to solve their typing issues,

10

有助于使它们的类型更加明显。

我发现他们令人沮丧，或者可能只是我感到沮丧
Where I find them to be frustrating or maybe it's just me frustrated about

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:44.909
生态系统是我们似乎立即跳到的，这是唯一的选择。
the ecosystem is that we seem to jump immediately to, that's the only option.

13
00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.859
如果有类型，则可以完全忽略类型并使用三重等于，或者
If you have types, you can either ignore types entirely and use triple equals, or

14
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.670
你可以跳到另一个极端，

它是JavaScript之上的一层，
which is layer on something on top of JavaScript,

16
00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.619
我认为这根本不是JavaScript的DNA。

我希望在两者之间有一些东西。

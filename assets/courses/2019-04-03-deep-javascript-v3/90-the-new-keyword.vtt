00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.542
>> 凯尔辛普森: 好的，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right,

2
00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:03.971
第三种方法是调用函数使用新关键字。
the third way that we'll look at
invoking functions uses the new keyword.

3
00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:08.881
我完全理解新关键词好像有什么关系
And I fully understand that the new
keyword seems as if it has something to

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.550
与调用类构造函数一起使用。
do with invoking class constructors.

5
00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.429
这与班级没有关系。
This has not got anything
to do with classes.

6
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.399
这只是一种不幸的语法
It's just an unfortunate syntactic

7
00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.059
让它看起来像是在处理课的时候
trick to make it look like it's dealing
with classes when it really isn't.

8
00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.039
实际上，新关键字是您可以调用函数的第三种方法。
Actually, the new keyword is the third
way that you can invoke a function.

9
00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.239
结果证明它做了 4 件非常具体的事情
And it turns out that it does
four very specific things,

10
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.189
我要为你准备的名单
which I'm about to list for you.

11
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.840
它做了四个非常具体的事情
It does four very specific things,

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.929
当你看电话时就不太明显了
which are not particularly obvious
when you look at the call say.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.670
但是新关键字的目的实际上是要调用
But the purpose of the new
keyword is actually to invoke

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.670
具有指向整个新空对象的此关键字的函数。
a function with a this keyword
pointing at a whole new empty object.

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.939
如果我们调用函数并将它们指向上下文对象，
If we have invoking functions and
pointing them at a context object,

16
00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.880
就像个 workshop.ask ，那是一个方法。
like a workshop.ask, that's one way.

17
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.981
或者我们说我要调用一个函数并给它指定一个特定的对象。
Or we say I'm gonna invoke a function and
give it a specific object with .call or

18
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:06.299
.apply 或我将用一个 .bind 来强制它。
.apply or I'm gonna force it with a .bind.

19
00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.569
第三种方法是说我想调用一个函数
A third way of doing it is to say
I wanna invoke a function and

20
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.109
使用全新的空对象。
use a whole new empty object.

21
00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.730
新的关键词可以做到这一点。
And the new keyword can accomplish that.

22
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.879
它做其他事情但也完成了这一任务
It does other stuff, but
it also accomplishes that task,

23
00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.980
即用新的空对象调用函数。
which is to invoke a function
with a new empty object.

24
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.849
现在我要说你可以实现同样的目标
Now, I would say that you could
accomplish that same goal

25
00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.349
通过话，函数点调用，打开，闭合的大括号。
by saying, function dot call,
open, close curly bracket.

26
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.340
将在全新空对象的上下文中调用您的函数的 Cuz 。
Cuz that would invoke your function in
the context of a brand new empty object.

27
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.939
所以新的关键词并不是真正地向你买除了语法糖之外
So the new keyword isn't actually buying
you much except the syntactic sugar of,

28
00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.849
我希望此函数使用新的此内容调用。
hey I want this function invoked
with a new this content.

29
00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.439
这是我们第三次也是最后的方式。
That's our third and
final way of doing it.

30
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.069
那么这四件事情是怎样的呢 ?
So what are those four things by the way?

31
00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.150
你要在这张幻灯片上再参考一下
You're gonna wanna be able to
refer back to this slide in a bit.

32
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.010
这个关键词的四个方面是什么，
What are the four things
that the this keyword,

33
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.969
当它用来调用我们的功能时，新关键字会做什么，我
that the new keyword is going to do when
it's used to invoke our function, what I

34
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.355
用重质空气加一个构造函数的话，这四个东西是什么 ?
call a with heavy air quotes a constructor
call, what are those four things?

35
00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:18.219
数字 1，我们创建一个全新的空对象。
Number 1, number 1 we create
a brand new empty object.

36
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.038
我们已经知道了这部分但我们创造了一个全新的空物体
Well we already know that part but
we create a brand new empty object out

37
00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.819
这就是新关键词所做的
of thin air,
that's what the new keyword does.

38
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.239
数字 2，新关键字将该对象链接到另一个对象。
Number 2, the new keyword links
that object to another object.

39
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.212
你在想什么呢
And you're thinking link, what?

40
00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:35.837
这就是为什么那里有个星号
That's why there's an asterisk there.

41
00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:38.009
我们会回来解释联系的
We'll come back and
explain the linkage later.

42
00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.460
但它首先创建一个全新的对象，然后将它链接到某个地方。
But it first creates a brand new
object and then links it somewhere.

43
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.250
然后第三号调用函数
And then number 3,
it invokes the function,

44
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180
它用它的，这个，关键字指向新对象来调用这个函数。
it calls the function with its, this,
keyword pointed at the new object.

45
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.360
不是链接对象，新对象。
Not the linked object, the new object.

46
00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.134
>> Kyle Simpson: 第四，最后，函数调用后的新关键字
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And fourth and finally,
the new keyword after the function call is

47
00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:03.807
完成，如果该函数不返回其自己的对象，
done, if that function does
not return its own object,

48
00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:07.967
新关键字假定您打算返回此关键字。
the new keyword assumes that you
meant to return this keyword.

49
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:12.751
>> Kyle Simpson: 因此，这四种情况在每次出现新关键字时都发生
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So these four things
happen every single time a new keyword is

50
00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:14.849
使用函数调用。
invoked with a function.

51
00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.545
现在我只想从某种意义上说
Now I just wanna ask
sort of in a meta sense,

52
00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:22.037
当我用这种方式描述的时候
which one, when I describe it this way,

53
00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:27.397
这两个实体中的哪一个好像都在做呢 ?
which of the two entities seems
like it's doing all the work?

54
00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:30.252
似乎新关键字正在执行所有工作，或者
Does it seem like the new keyword
is doing all the work, or

55
00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:33.655
你的构造函数是否能完成所有工作
does it seem like your constructor
function's doing all the work?

56
00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:37.909
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 这真的是新的关键词吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's really
the new keyword, isn't it?

57
00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.599
事实上如果你在几乎所有功能上都有新的内容
As a matter of fact, if you put new
in front of almost any function,

58
00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.319
即使是一个完全空的功能，所有四种情况都将发生。
even a completely empty function,
all four of these things would happen.

59
00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.009
几乎就像功能根本不重要
It’s almost as if the function
doesn’t even matter.

60
00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.960
新关键字只是把它的功能
The new keyword is just sort
of hijacking the function so

61
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.189
它能做到这四件事
that it can do these four things.

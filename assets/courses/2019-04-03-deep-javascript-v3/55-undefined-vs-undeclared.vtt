00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.149
>> Kyle Simpson: 让我们确保在整个未定义的问题上完全清楚
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's make sure we're
fully clear on this whole undefined

2
00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.209
与未申报的事物之间的关系。
versus undeclared thing.

3
00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.349
也许能对你们一些人进行审查但我们要确保我们的安全
Might be review for some of you but
let's just make sure we're fully clear.

4
00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.810
未定义和未声明的差别是什么 ?
What is the difference between
undefined and undeclared?

5
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.752
有人吗
Anyone?

6
00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.144
>> 扬声器 2: 您正在声明此变量存在，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're declaring
this variable exist,

7
00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.469
我不是给它赋值而是存在的
I'm not assigning it a value but it exist.

8
00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.211
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 好的，那是真的。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, that's true.

9
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:22.320
>> 扬声器 2: 因此已声明但未定义。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
there it's declared but not defined.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.785
>> 凯尔辛普森: 好的。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay.

11
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:26.472
>> 扬声器 3: 未声明。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undeclared.

12
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.384
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 好吧，那是其中的一部分，你是在正确的轨道上，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, that's part
of it, you're on the right track but

13
00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:30.620
这还不是全部的
that's not all of it yet.

14
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.491
>> 扬声器 3: 未声明的内存从未在
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undeclared has have
never had the memory allocated during

15
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.390
编译器解析阶段，而未定义。
the compiler parsing
stage whereas undefined.

16
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.920
也许它被分配了但从未被赋予过这样的价值
Maybe it was allocated but there's
never been a value assigned to that.

17
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.560
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森:
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Putting both of

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.729
你的答案我们可以得到完整的答案
your answers together we can
get the complete answer.

19
00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:48.679
因此，让我重申这一点。
So let me restate that.

20
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.719
你俩都是对的
You are both correct.

21
00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.990
你是在正确的轨道上让我重申这一点
You're on the right track so
let me restate this.

22
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.579
这两者之间的差异，未定义的表示变量存在，但
The difference between these two,
undefined means a variable exists but

23
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.189
在它没有价值的时候
at the moment it has no value.

24
00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.640
它可能从来没有价值，或者曾经有价值，也没有价值
It may have never had a value or it might
have used to have a value and it doesn't

25
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.280
但是空间的真空中没有其他的值是没有定义的，是吧 ?
anymore but there is no other value in the
vacuum of space it is undefined, right?

26
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.579
即使发音与未声明的同义词相似，仍未声明
Undeclared even though they sound
like synonyms undeclared is actually

27
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.359
从未正式宣布过任何我们可以进入的范围
never formally declared in any
scope that we have accessed to.

28
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.099
这就是未申报的意思
That's what undeclared means.

29
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:22.868
我们没有大理石。
We do not have a marble for it.

30
00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:28.438
在严格的模式下，它总是会产生这些参考区域，好吗 ?
And in strict mode, it always results
in those reference areas, okay?

31
00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:32.039
保持直线是很重要的
It's important to keep those straight.

32
00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.974
不幸的是， JavaScript 试图解决这一问题并假装
Unfortunately, JavaScript tries to
mess around with this and pretend that

33
00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:40.031
未声明的类型与未定义的相同，并且有一些错误消息
undeclared is sort of the same thing as
undefined and some of its error messages

34
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:43.989
还有其他的东西和东西在历史上是个很糟糕的想法
and other outputtings and things and
not is historically a really bad idea.

35
00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.280
我们需要把这两个概念分开。
We need to keep these
two concepts separate.

36
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.930
有不同的东西被宣告不存在
There's a different something
being undeclared doesn't exist,

37
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.640
并明确定义它确实存在但没有价值
and being undefine definitely it does
exist, but doesn't have a value.

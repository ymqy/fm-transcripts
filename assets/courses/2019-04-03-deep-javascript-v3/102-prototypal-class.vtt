00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.520
>> Kyle Simpson: 相同类语法。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The same class syntax.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.039
但这就像在糖下面，这就是密码的样子。
But this is like the underneath the sugar,
this is what the code would look like.

3
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:14.539
这就是以前做原型班的学校方式，所以叫。
This is the old school way of doing
a prototypal class, so called.

4
00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.550
你注意到我们有一个工作坊的功能
You notice that we have a workshop
function which is going to serve sort of

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.730
构造函数的用途。
the purpose of the constructor.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.600
然后我们开始向 Workshop.prototype 添加方法。
And then we start adding methods
to the Workshop.prototype, and

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.440
我们会打新电话之类的
we cog new calls and stuff.

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.510
所以你可以看到一些阶级的基础
So you see some of
the underpinnings of classes, but

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.979
这就是在等级糖中发生的事情
this is the plumbing underneath what
is happening in the class sugar.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.070
因为如果你想做的话你就不会再写这代码了
It's not that you would really write this
code anymore because if you wanted to do

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
几乎可以肯定的是使用类语法。
classes at all you almost certainly
be using the class syntax.

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.399
你不会再写这个原型代码了但我认为
You wouldn't write this prototypal code
anymore, but I think it's important for

13
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.850
你知道这些水管是怎么工作的
you to understand how this plumbing works.

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.049
关系在哪里 ?
Where are the relationships?

15
00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.869
这些联系都在哪里 ?
Where are all of those linkages?

16
00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:57.950
因为他们不是拷贝，因为拷贝其实是一个不好的心理模型，
Since they're not copies and since
copying is actually a bad mental model,

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.340
我们需要一个不同的心理模型来帮助我们了解等级如何运作，
we need a different mental model that
helps us understand how class works, how

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.310
它真的有用，所以我们可以理解它休息的时候，为什么会中断呢 ?
it really works, so that we can understand
when it breaks, why did it break?

19
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.530
为什么它做的事情跟我们预期的不一样 ?
Why did it do something
different than what we expected?

&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：关于未定义与未声明的快速说明。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: A quick note on undefined versus undeclared.

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.389
这通常是令人困惑的。
This is often confused.

3
00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.220
这是令人困惑的，因为开发者，很自然地，
And it's confused because developers, quite naturally,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.990
把这些词看作是一种同义词。
think of these words as sort of synonyms.

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.170
看起来他们的意思几乎是一样的。
They seem like they mean kind of almost the same thing.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.089
在英语中，这可能是真的。
And in English, that's probably true.

7
00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.739
但在编程中，这完全不是真的。
But in programming, it's entirely not true.

8
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.600
在编程中，特别是在JavaScript中，
In programming, and especially in JavaScript,

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.059
这是两个完全不同的概念。
these are two entirely different concepts.

10
00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.609
所以在上一张幻灯片上，当我说V型的时候，我得到了引用，
So on the previous slide, when I said type of V, and I got back quote,

11
00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.270
UNDEFINED，V或其他变量，甚至不存在。
undefined, V or whatever that variable is, didn't even exist.

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.280
所以，当有些东西甚至没有定义的时候，我怎么才能拿回未定义的报价呢？
So how is it that I can get back quote undefined when something doesn't even

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.539
存在吗？
exist?

14
00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.679
好吧，这是另一个历史性的疣，JavaScript试图假装
Well, that's another historical wart, JavaScript trying to pretend as if

15
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.219
没有声明也没什么大不了的。
the absence of a declaration isn't that big a deal.

16
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.460
这不是什么大问题，你可以解决它。
It's not that big of a problem, you can work around it.

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.719
回想起来，他们根本就不应该这么做。
In retrospect, they never should have done that.

18
00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.250
它们应该只是返回一个未声明的字符串。
They should have just returned a string undeclared.

19
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.500
未声明意味着它从未在我们有权访问的任何作用域中创建。
Undeclared means it's never been created in any scope that we have access to.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.620
而未定义意味着肯定有一个变量，而目前，
And undefined means there's definitely a variable, and at the moment,

21
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.335
它没有价值。
it has no value.

22
00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:12.284
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：非常不同的事情。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Very different things.

23
00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:15.626
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：运算符的类型是存在的唯一运算符
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The type of operator is the only operator in existence

24
00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:20.393
它能够引用不存在的东西，并且不会抛出错误。
that is able to reference a thing that doesn't exist and not throw an error.

25
00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:25.168
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：现在，未定义和
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now, undefined and

26
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.890
在未声明的情况下，我们可以相当直截了当地筛选出来。
undeclared, we can fairly straightforwardly sift those out.

27
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.902
但是在引入的语言中还有另一个空虚的概念，
But there's another concept of emptiness in the language that was introduced with,

28
00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:36.498
本质上，ES6。
essentially, ES6.

29
00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:39.688
描述这一点的最好方式是未初始化。
And the best way to describe this is uninitialized.

30
00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.200
另一种方式来指代这个特殊的
Another way of referring to this particular

31
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.560
变量可以处于的条件称为TDZ，即时间死区。
condition that a variable can be in is called the TDZ, the temporal dead zone.

32
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.829
在我们讨论的下一个单元中，我们将会对此进行更多的讨论
We're gonna get much more into this in our next unit of discussion when we talk

33
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.500
关于范围。
about scopes.

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.599
我们要谈谈这东西是从哪里来的。
We're gonna talk about where this thing comes from.

35
00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.450
但本质上，这个想法是某些变量，比如块范围的变量，
But essentially, the idea is that certain variables, like block scope ones,

36
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.989
不要初始化。
don't get initialized.

37
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.579
它们从来不会最初设置为undefined。
They never initially get set to undefined.

38
00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.650
当某物处于未初始化状态时，它是禁止的。
When something is in an uninitialized state, it is off-limits.

39
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.360
你不允许以任何方式触摸它，形状或形式，否则你会得到一个错误，并且
You're not allowed to touch it in any way, shape or form, or you'll get an error, and

40
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.530
您得到的错误是TDZ错误。
the error you get is the TDZ error.

41
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.352
所以这是我们对这种空虚的另一个概念。
So it's yet another concept that we have of this emptiness.

42
00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:21.229
我们可以有一个从未初始化的变量。
We can have a variable that's never been initialized.

43
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.170
我们可以有一个已初始化的未定义的变量。
We can have a variable that's been initialized that is undefined.

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.159
或者我们可以有一个从未创建过的变量，然后它是未声明的。
Or we can have a variable that was never even created, and then it's undeclared.

45
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.500
三个不同的概念，我们需要我们的大脑围绕着这三个不同的概念。
Three different concepts that we need to wrap our brains around.

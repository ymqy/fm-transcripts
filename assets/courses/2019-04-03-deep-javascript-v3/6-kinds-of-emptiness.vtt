00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.000
>> Kyle Simpson: 未定义与未声明的快速注释。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: A quick note
on undefined versus undeclared.

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.389
这通常是混淆的。
This is often confused.

3
00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.220
这很困惑因为开发者很自然地
And it's confused because developers,
quite naturally,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.990
将这些词视为同义词。
think of these words as sort of synonyms.

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.170
他们好像是差不多一样的意思
They seem like they mean kind
of almost the same thing.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.089
用英语来说那可能是真的
And in English, that's probably true.

7
00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.739
但在编程中，这完全不是真的。
But in programming,
it's entirely not true.

8
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.600
在编程中，尤其是在 JavaScript中，
In programming, and
especially in JavaScript,

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.059
这是两个完全不同的概念。
these are two entirely different concepts.

10
00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.609
所以在前一张幻灯片上，当我说 V 型的时候，我收回了报价，
So on the previous slide, when I said
type of V, and I got back quote,

11
00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.270
未定义的 V 或任何变量都是不存在的。
undefined, V or whatever that variable is,
didn't even exist.

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.280
我怎么能在什么都不知道的时候再引用
So how is it that I can get back quote
undefined when something doesn't even

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.539
是否存在?
exist?

14
00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.679
那是另一个历史上的疣 JavaScript 试图假装
Well, that's another historical wart,
JavaScript trying to pretend as if

15
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.219
没有宣言就没什么大不了的
the absence of a declaration
isn't that big a deal.

16
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.460
这不是一个大问题，你可以在它周围工作。
It's not that big of a problem,
you can work around it.

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.719
事后看来，他们绝对不应该这样做。
In retrospect,
they never should have done that.

18
00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.250
它们应该已返回未声明的字符串。
They should have just
returned a string undeclared.

19
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.500
未声明的表示它从未在我们有权访问的任何范围内创建。
Undeclared means it's never been created
in any scope that we have access to.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.620
没有定义的意思是肯定有一个变量在那一刻
And undefined means there's definitely
a variable, and at the moment,

21
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.335
它没有值。
it has no value.

22
00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:12.284
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 非常不同的事情。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Very different things.

23
00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:15.626
>> Kyle Simpson: 运算符的类型是唯一存在的运算符
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The type of operator
is the only operator in existence

24
00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:20.393
它可以引用不存在的东西而不抛出错误。
that is able to reference a thing that
doesn't exist and not throw an error.

25
00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:25.168
>> Kyle Simpson: 现在，未定义和
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now, undefined and

26
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.890
没有声明我们可以直截了当地筛选出来
undeclared, we can fairly
straightforwardly sift those out.

27
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.902
但在引入的语言中还有一个空虚的概念，
But there's another concept of emptiness
in the language that was introduced with,

28
00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:36.498
本质上是 ES6
essentially, ES6.

29
00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:39.688
而描述这一问题的最佳方式是未初始化。
And the best way to describe
this is uninitialized.

30
00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.200
另一个提及这一问题的方法
Another way of referring
to this particular

31
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.560
变量可以被称为 TDZ，即时间死区。
condition that a variable can be in is
called the TDZ, the temporal dead zone.

32
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.829
我们会在接下来的讨论中得到更多的信息
We're gonna get much more into this in
our next unit of discussion when we talk

33
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.500
关于作用域的信息。
about scopes.

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.599
我们要谈谈这东西是从哪里来的
We're gonna talk about where
this thing comes from.

35
00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.450
但基本上，这个想法是某些变量，比如块作用域，
But essentially, the idea is that certain
variables, like block scope ones,

36
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.989
别被初始化
don't get initialized.

37
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.579
它们最初从未被设置为未定义。
They never initially get set to undefined.

38
00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.650
当某些内容处于未初始化状态时，它将处于关闭状态。
When something is in an uninitialized
state, it is off-limits.

39
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.360
不允许您以任何方式，形状或表单来触摸它，也不允许您发生错误，并且
You're not allowed to touch it in any way,
shape or form, or you'll get an error, and

40
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.530
您获取的错误是 TDZ 错误。
the error you get is the TDZ error.

41
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.352
这也是我们这个空虚的另一个概念。
So it's yet another concept
that we have of this emptiness.

42
00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:21.229
我们可以有一个从未被初始化过的变量。
We can have a variable that's
never been initialized.

43
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.170
我们可以有一个未定义的变量已初始化。
We can have a variable that's been
initialized that is undefined.

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.159
或者我们可以有一个从未被创造过的变量，然后它就被取消了。
Or we can have a variable that was never
even created, and then it's undeclared.

45
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.500
我们需要用三个不同的概念来总结我们的大脑。
Three different concepts that we
need to wrap our brains around.

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.229
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 现在我的论点是，我总是从人民中回来，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now the argument
I always get back from people,

2
00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:05.000
而你们中的一些人也许正在想
and some of you may be thinking
this at this moment is, yeah,

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.970
但即使我坐在你的工作室里我也学会了这些细微差别
but even if I sat through your workshop
and I learned all these nuances and

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.310
我读了那个规范我的代码库上的那些小恶魔呢
I read the spec, what about all
the junior devs on my code base?

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.349
他们永远不会懂这些东西
They would never understand this stuff.

6
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.039
事实上，在理论上，我几乎比任何一个问题都能找到我。
This I actually, in theory, hits me
almost more than any question I ever get.

7
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.350
这种心态说我够聪明的
This mindset that says,
well I'm smart enough but

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.050
那些小鬼子太蠢了
those junior devs they're too
dumb to understand this stuff.

9
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.989
这完全是无稽之谈。
That is complete and total nonsense.

10
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.699
我不知道你的背景
I don't know what your backgrounds are,
but

11
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.000
你们每个人都很出色
everyone of you is
excellent at what you do.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.929
您可能知道 JavaScript 的更多或更少，但这不会使您变得更笨，
You may know more or less about JavaScript
but that doesn't make you dumber and

13
00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.770
不太了解事物的能力，学习事物的能力更少。
less capable of understanding stuff,
less capable of learning things.

14
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:47.789
我不相信我们应该这样做
I do not subscribe to
the belief that we should

15
00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.450
把我们的密码基础降到最低的共同标准
dumb down our code basis to
the lowest common denominator.

16
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.909
您应该尽可能有效地使用这些工具。
You should absolutely use the tools
as effectively as you can.

17
00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.000
您应该尽可能了解如何使用这些工具。
You should be as obvious about how
you're using the tools as possible.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.629
当有人在代码库中谁不理解
And when somebody is on the code
base who doesn't understand,

19
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.500
把它作为一个学习的机会。
use it as an opportunity for
them to learn.

20
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.969
使用代码复审，
Use code reviews,

21
00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.469
使用对等学习的文化，配对在一起。
use a culture of peer-to-peer learning,
of pairing together.

22
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.989
所有这些都有助于每个人更好地了解工具的运作方式。
All of those things to help everybody
learn how the tool works better.

23
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.769
当你收到密码审查的时候，一些初级的开发者做了一些蠢事，
When you receive a code review and
some junior developer did something dumb,

24
00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.019
就好像他们没做任何胁迫一样也许有个角落
like they didn't do a coercion correct and
maybe there's some corner case they didn't

25
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.930
知道吗，你不拒绝密码评论，说，你是哑巴。
know about, you don't reject the code
review and say, you're dumb.

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.329
你说嘿过来跟我坐一会儿
You say, hey,
come sit with me for a minute,

27
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.759
让我跟你谈谈你不知道的那个街角的情况
let me just talk to you about this corner
case that you weren't aware of, and

28
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.748
如果你做了这件事我们会彻底避免角落里的
if you did this thing instead we'd
avoid that corner case entirely.

29
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:41.900
现在你学到了更好，学到了更好。
Now you learned better and
they learned better.

30
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.870
这是一个完整的掩体论点这是一个懒惰的借口
This is a complete bunk argument,
it's a lazy excuse for

31
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.289
不想在我们的开发团队中做我们应该做的事
not wanting to actually do what we ought
to do on our developer teams, which is

32
00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.810
大家应该学习，每个人都要向上。
promote that everybody should be learning,
everybody should be headed upward.

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.920
我不在乎你在哪里，我在乎你的方向是什么，你要向上吗 ?
I don't care where you are, I care what
your direction is, are you headed upward?

34
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.729
您是否了解有关工具的更多信息 ?
Are you learning more about your tool?

35
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.370
这不是不使用工具的借口。
This is not an excuse for
not using the tools well.

36
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.640
这也不是聪明的借口，对。
It is also not an excuse for
being clever, right.

37
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.900
有人说，这里的斜坡问题是很危险的。
Some people say,
well the slippery slope argument here.

38
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.430
我可以做这些聪明的数学运算，对。
I can do all this clever bit-wise math,
right.

39
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.370
我在用这个工具我很聪明
I'm using the tool and
I'm being clever, and I'm doing all of

40
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.819
我在一个代码行上编程，我们以前用 Perl 做的方式。
my programming on one line of code,
the way we used to do in Perl.

41
00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.879
我也不是这么说的
That's not what I'm saying, either.

42
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.920
我想说的是你的密码是一种通讯方式
What I'm actually saying is that your
code is a form of communication, and

43
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.860
有一种有效的通信方式，能够很好地理解和使用该工具。
there is an effective way to communicate
that understands and uses the tool well.

44
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.270
如果您请求代码的读者了解有关工具的信息，请
If you ask the reader of a code to
understand something about the tool so

45
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.670
他们可以理解这条代码，那就是对他们的投资。
that they can understand that line of
code, that is an investment on their part.

46
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.020
确保投资超出该行代码的范围。
Make sure that that investment
pays off beyond that line of code.

47
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.599
确保当他们了解如何工作时，他们会看到更多的信息。
Make sure that when they learn how that
worked, they're gonna see more of that.

48
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.069
他们知道你是怎么做怪事的
Rather than,
they learn how you did something weird,

49
00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.560
然后他们就再也不用再利用这个了
esoteric bitwise trick, and then they
never get to use that ever again.

50
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.639
那是浪费他们的时间
That's a waste of their time.

51
00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.900
让你感觉好但那是浪费时间
Makes you feel good but
it's a waste of the time.

52
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.819
这也是为什么我们有如此多的努力才能有良好的发展文化
And it's part of the reason why we
struggle so much to have good dev culture,

53
00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.930
我们没有把重点放在促进所有人都能理解的问题上
cuz we're not focused on promoting that
everybody should be able to understand.

54
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.710
从三个星期的人到其中一个人
From the person who is three weeks into
JavaScript to somebody who's been at it

55
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.090
像我这样的二十年
for 20 plus years like me,

56
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.641
我们应该能够在同一个代码库中进行互操作并进行良好的沟通。
we all oughta be able to interoperate on
the same code base and communicate well.

57
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:28.129
是啊小鬼子需要学习一些东西但那就是
Yeah, the junior devs gonna need to learn
some stuff, but that's what happens in

58
00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.120
每个行业每个行业都要学习一些东西
every job and in every industry,
you have to learn some stuff.

59
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.310
你没看到建筑师说
You don't see an architect saying,

60
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.090
我们不打算把这栋大楼设计得太好了
well we're not gonna design that building
well cuz we've got an intern on the job.

61
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.120
你教实习生如何构建好建筑
You teach the intern how
to build the building well.

62
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.139
这就是我们要做的
That's what we need to be doing.

63
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.020
我们需要使用 JavaScript 的所有部分，但是
We need to be doing with all
parts of JavaScript, but

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.610
尤其是每个人都能让你忽略的部分
especially the parts that everybody
tells you to ignore like types.

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.229
&GT；&GT；Kyle Simpson：现在我总是从人们那里得到的论点，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now the argument I always get back from people,

2
00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:05.000
你们中的一些人可能会认为现在这个是，是的，
and some of you may be thinking this at this moment is, yeah,

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.970
但即使我坐在你的工作室里学到了所有这些细微的差别
but even if I sat through your workshop and I learned all these nuances and

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.310
我读了规范，那么我代码库上所有的初级开发人员呢？
I read the spec, what about all the junior devs on my code base?

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.349
他们永远不会理解这些东西。
They would never understand this stuff.

6
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.039
实际上，从理论上讲，这个问题几乎比我收到的任何问题都更让我震惊。
This I actually, in theory, hits me almost more than any question I ever get.

7
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.350
这种心态说，好吧，我够聪明，但是
This mindset that says, well I'm smart enough but

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.050
那些年轻的开发人员，他们太笨了，不能理解这些东西。
those junior devs they're too dumb to understand this stuff.

9
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.989
这完全是胡说八道。
That is complete and total nonsense.

10
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.699
我不知道你的背景是什么，但是
I don't know what your backgrounds are, but

11
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.000
你们每个人都很擅长自己的工作。
everyone of you is excellent at what you do.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.929
您可能或多或少了解JavaScript，但这并不会让您变得更笨
You may know more or less about JavaScript but that doesn't make you dumber and

13
00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.770
理解事物的能力较弱，学习事物的能力较弱。
less capable of understanding stuff, less capable of learning things.

14
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:47.789
我不同意我们应该
I do not subscribe to the belief that we should

15
00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.450
将我们的代码基础降低到最低公分母。
dumb down our code basis to the lowest common denominator.

16
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.909
你绝对应该尽可能有效地使用这些工具。
You should absolutely use the tools as effectively as you can.

17
00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.000
你应该尽可能清楚你是如何使用这些工具的。
You should be as obvious about how you're using the tools as possible.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.629
当有人在代码基础上不理解的时候，
And when somebody is on the code base who doesn't understand,

19
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.500
利用它作为他们学习的机会。
use it as an opportunity for them to learn.

20
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.969
使用代码评审，
Use code reviews,

21
00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.469
使用点对点学习的文化，结对在一起。
use a culture of peer-to-peer learning, of pairing together.

22
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.989
所有这些都可以帮助每个人了解该工具如何更好地工作。
All of those things to help everybody learn how the tool works better.

23
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.769
当您收到代码审查时，一些初级开发人员做了一些愚蠢的事情，
When you receive a code review and some junior developer did something dumb,

24
00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.019
就像他们没有做正确的强制，也许有一些角落的情况，他们没有
like they didn't do a coercion correct and maybe there's some corner case they didn't

25
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.930
知道，你不会拒绝代码审查并说，你很笨。
know about, you don't reject the code review and say, you're dumb.

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.329
你说，嘿，过来和我坐一会儿，
You say, hey, come sit with me for a minute,

27
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.759
让我跟你谈谈你不知道的那个角落里的案子，而且
let me just talk to you about this corner case that you weren't aware of, and

28
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.748
如果你做这件事，我们会完全避免那个角落的情况。
if you did this thing instead we'd avoid that corner case entirely.

29
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:41.900
现在你学得更好了，他们学得也更好了。
Now you learned better and they learned better.

30
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.870
这是一个彻头彻尾的胡说八道，这是一个懒惰的借口
This is a complete bunk argument, it's a lazy excuse for

31
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.289
不想在我们的开发团队中真正做我们应该做的事情，这就是
not wanting to actually do what we ought to do on our developer teams, which is

32
00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.810
提倡每个人都应该学习，每个人都应该向上。
promote that everybody should be learning, everybody should be headed upward.

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.920
我不在乎你在哪里，我在乎你的方向是什么，你是在往上走吗？
I don't care where you are, I care what your direction is, are you headed upward?

34
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.729
您正在了解有关工具的更多信息吗？
Are you learning more about your tool?

35
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.370
这不是不能很好地使用工具的借口。
This is not an excuse for not using the tools well.

36
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.640
这也不是聪明的借口，对吧。
It is also not an excuse for being clever, right.

37
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.900
有人说，这里的滑坡论。
Some people say, well the slippery slope argument here.

38
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.430
我可以做所有这些聪明的小数学，对吧。
I can do all this clever bit-wise math, right.

39
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.370
我在使用这个工具，我很聪明，我正在做所有的事情
I'm using the tool and I'm being clever, and I'm doing all of

40
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.819
我在一行代码上进行编程，就像我们以前在Perl中所做的那样。
my programming on one line of code, the way we used to do in Perl.

41
00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.879
我也不是这个意思。
That's not what I'm saying, either.

42
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.920
我实际上想说的是，您的代码是一种通信形式，并且
What I'm actually saying is that your code is a form of communication, and

43
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.860
有一种有效的沟通方式可以很好地理解和使用工具。
there is an effective way to communicate that understands and uses the tool well.

44
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.270
如果您要求代码的读者了解有关工具的一些内容，那么
If you ask the reader of a code to understand something about the tool so

45
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.670
他们能够理解这行代码，这是他们的一项投资。
that they can understand that line of code, that is an investment on their part.

46
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.020
确保投资的回报超出了这一行代码。
Make sure that that investment pays off beyond that line of code.

47
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.599
确保当他们知道这是如何工作的，他们会看到更多的。
Make sure that when they learn how that worked, they're gonna see more of that.

48
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.069
而不是，他们知道你是如何做一些奇怪的事情，
Rather than, they learn how you did something weird,

49
00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.560
深奥的比特把戏，然后他们再也不会使用它了。
esoteric bitwise trick, and then they never get to use that ever again.

50
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.639
那是浪费他们的时间。
That's a waste of their time.

51
00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.900
让你感觉很好，但这是浪费时间。
Makes you feel good but it's a waste of the time.

52
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.819
这也是我们为拥有良好的开发文化而努力奋斗的部分原因，
And it's part of the reason why we struggle so much to have good dev culture,

53
00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.930
因为我们并不是专注于推广每个人都应该能够理解的东西。
cuz we're not focused on promoting that everybody should be able to understand.

54
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.710
从学习JavaScript三周的人到一直在做这件事的人
From the person who is three weeks into JavaScript to somebody who's been at it

55
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.090
像我这样20多年来，
for 20 plus years like me,

56
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.641
我们都应该能够在相同的代码库上进行互操作，并且能够很好地沟通。
we all oughta be able to interoperate on the same code base and communicate well.

57
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:28.129
是的，初级开发人员需要学习一些东西，但这就是发生在
Yeah, the junior devs gonna need to learn some stuff, but that's what happens in

58
00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.120
每一份工作，每一个行业，你都必须学习一些东西。
every job and in every industry, you have to learn some stuff.

59
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.310
你看不到建筑师说，
You don't see an architect saying,

60
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.090
嗯，我们不会设计好那栋楼，因为我们有一个实习生在工作。
well we're not gonna design that building well cuz we've got an intern on the job.

61
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.120
你教实习生如何建好大楼。
You teach the intern how to build the building well.

62
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.139
这就是我们需要做的。
That's what we need to be doing.

63
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.020
我们需要处理JavaScript的所有部分，但是
We need to be doing with all parts of JavaScript, but

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.610
特别是那些每个人都告诉你要忽略的部分，比如类型。
especially the parts that everybody tells you to ignore like types.

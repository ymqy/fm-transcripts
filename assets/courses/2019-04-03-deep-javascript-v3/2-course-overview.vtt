00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.750
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 我相信 JavaScript 可以分为三个核心，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I believe JavaScript
can be divided into three cores,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.919
三根支柱如果你愿意的话
three pillars if you will.

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.730
这三大支柱对于
And those three pillars
are absolutely critical for

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.990
所有你要做的 JavaScript 编码
all of the JavaScript coding
that you will ever do,

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.899
即使有品牌名称 React 或品牌名称 Vue.js 或品牌 Angular。
even if it has the brand name React or the
brand name Vue.js or the brand Angular.

6
00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:19.910
你猜是什么
Guess what?

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.179
或者像我这样的老学校
Or even for the old school folks like me,

8
00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.019
即使是 JQuery 仍然是 JavaScript 好吗
even if it's jQuery it's still JavaScript,
okay?

9
00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.629
这些东西仍然以同样的基本支柱为基础。
And those things are still based
upon the same fundamental pillars.

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.807
我看到开发商一直在自我缠绕和扭曲自己
And I see developers all the time, winding
themselves and contorting themselves

11
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:39.573
围绕着特定框架内的各种古怪行为
around all kinds of certain weirdness
within their particular framework or

12
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.838
不管他们在做什么
utility whatever it is they're working on.

13
00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:46.142
结果是他们不了解其中一个支柱，或者
And it turns out it's they don't
understand one of the pillars, or

14
00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:48.340
这些支柱之一的一部分
some part of one of these pillars.

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.307
这个课程的目的就是要解决这个问题。
And this course aims to fix that.

16
00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:55.216
我有一个疯狂的想法如果你选择了你
I have this crazy notion that if for
whatever reason you've chosen you

17
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:59.957
让你的事业成为一个 JavaScript 开发者如果你选择
to make your career be a JavaScript
developer, if you've chosen to

18
00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:04.555
拿到钱来写 JavaScript 你应该明白你的工具
get paid to write JavaScript,
you oughta understand your tool.

19
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:07.016
那么，我们要看看这三大支柱是怎样的呢 ?
So what are we going to
look at those three pillar?

20
00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.996
这些支柱中的第一个支柱可能是最不受欢迎的
The first of those pillars may be the
least popular of them actually definitely

21
00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:14.192
最不受欢迎的，没有人喜欢谈类型，
the least popular of them,
nobody likes to talk about types and

22
00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:17.632
尤其是在像 JavaScript这样的动态语言中
especially within a dynamically
typed language like JavaScript,

23
00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:19.402
这是一个禁忌话题。
this is one of those taboo topics.

24
00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:24.754
如果你跟踪 Doug Crockford 他会告诉你别用这些东西
If you follow a Doug Crockford, he tells
you don't use any of this stuff don't

25
00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:30.043
想想这些当然不是实际可行的
think about any of these things of course,
that isn’t actually practical.

26
00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:34.270
我们要谈谈为什么你应该关心类型。
And we're gonna talk about why
you should care about types.

27
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.680
但我还是会把豆子洒在这里
But I will just go ahead and
spill the beans here.

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.890
这个特殊单位的核心外卖是
The takeaway from this particular core for
this particular unit is,

29
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.870
你写代码是不负责任的
it is irresponsible of
you to write code and

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.520
不了解这个语言的这个批判性的这个事实，好吗 ?
not understand this critical
fact of the language, okay?

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.219
说的是不负责任的，好一些好的地方让我尽量避免
It is irresponsible to say, well,
some good parts told me to just avoid that

32
00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.799
题，别学了，不用担心。
topic, don't learn it,
don't need to worry about it.

33
00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.659
这是人们在代码中产生虫子的主要原因之一。
That is one of the big reasons why
people produce bugs in their code.

34
00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.530
他们写代码，他们不了解他们在写的代码，好吗 ?
They write code and they don't understand
the code that they're writing, okay?

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.389
这样我们就能覆盖这些类型，特别是强制系统。
So we're gonna cover the types and
specifically the coercion system.

36
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.639
现在我要对它敞开心心因为我知道你这么做
Now, I'm gonna ask to have an open mind
on it because I know you have been so

37
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.639
编程来认为我们不需要做这些事我们只应该
programmed to think that we don't need
to do these things, we should only just

38
00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.219
用三等比，如果我们用三等号，谁需要在乎呢 ?
use the triple equals, and who needs to
care about it if we use the triple equals?

39
00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.569
这不是编写 JavaScript的实际方法。
That is just not a practical
way of writing JavaScript.

40
00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.340
你一直在想这不是有效的
You've been getting by,
and it's not effective.

41
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.729
所以我要让你在我告诉你的时候有个开放的想法
So I'm gonna ask you to have an open
mind when I tell you, and maybe more so

42
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.599
我就会有一个很坚强的
than I have ever before,
I'm gonna have a very strong,

43
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.069
我要把我的脚牢牢地植在你的位置
I'm gonna firmly plant my foot in
a position here about what you should be

44
00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.060
以强制方式执行，您应该使用 JavaScript 的类型系统。
doing with coercion, what you should
be doing with JavaScript's type system.

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.930
过去我有自己的想法，就像自己做自己的
In the past I've sort of have views that
were kind of like well just make your own

46
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.949
我相信我的观点已经改变了
sorts of decisions but I have come to
believe, my views have shifted and

47
00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.780
我得相信这是正确的想法
I have to come believe there is
a correct way to think about this and

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.930
我们还没到那里
we're not getting there yet.

49
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.520
我们还不是一个社区
We're not there yet as a community.

50
00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.039
所以也许我们在这个过程中能做的最重要的事情之一是
So maybe one of the most important
things we can do in this course is

51
00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.620
告诉你为什么这么重要吗
enlighten you to why that's so
important okay?

52
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.560
我们将要谈论的第二个核心单元是范围系统。
The second core unit that we're going
to talk about is the scope system.

53
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.129
Lexical scalsces ，引导我们讨论关闭和
Lexical scopes which leads us into
discussions about closure and

54
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.299
最终是模块化的模式
eventually the modular pattern.

55
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.629
这是语言的重要支柱。
This is a critical pillar of the language.

56
00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.750
几乎所有的东西都在它的基础上。
Almost everything else is built upon it.

57
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.400
第三个支柱是物体系统。
And the third of the pillars
is the objects system.

58
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.159
我喜欢把这个称为面向对象，有点不一样
I like to refer to this as the objects
oriented, a little bit different than

59
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.150
面向对象，它实际上是类定向的。
object oriented,
which is actually class oriented.

60
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.250
我们需要了解 JavaScript 的对象系统是如何运作的，
We need to understand how
JavaScript's objects system works,

61
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.400
包括这个关键词，完全是要做的事情，那就是
which includes the this keyword,
that completely befuddling thing that's

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.889
一旦你学会了它所做的事情
actually very straightforward once
you've been taught what it does.

63
00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.909
一旦你与其他语言的语言断开连接
Once you disconnect from what
it does in other languages and

64
00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.629
你知道它用 JavaScript 做什么是很直接的
you learn what it does in JavaScript,
it's very straightforward.

65
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.629
所以我们要了解这三个核心是很重要的。
So it's important for
us to understand all three of these cores.

66
00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.420
当我们深入研究这个
And when we dig into this and

67
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.840
然后我们就会去找原型你得先了解这些东西
then we dig into the prototypes, you have
to understand that stuff before you can

68
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.280
了解某个与类关键字类似的同步糖上的分层。
understand somebody layering on top
a syntactic sugar like the class keyword.

69
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.030
我没有在网上隐藏自己的思想和选项，
I have not hidden my thoughts and
options online about the class keyword and

70
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.159
我将再次告诉你，我坚信它不应该用在 JavaScript中。
I will tell you again I firmly believe
that it should not be used in JavaScript.

71
00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.110
但我的意思是你不应该用它
But there is a difference between
me saying, you shouldn't use it and

72
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.220
我说你不该学
me saying you shouldn't learn it.

73
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.220
你绝对应该学习这个系统
You absolutely should learn this system.

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.891
你绝对必须学会这个支柱来理解为什么
You absolutely must learn this pillar
to understand why that particular

75
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:29.718
编码风格不符合 JavaScript 和理解方式
coding style doesn't fit with JavaScript
and to understand, by the way,

76
00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:32.550
如果你被迫这么做怎么做那么好
if you are forced to do it,
how to do so well,

77
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.659
如果这个框架让你和他们中的许多人有这个选择
if that framework makes that choice for
you and many of them have.

78
00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.110
你还能有效还是要用眼罩来编码 ?
Can you still be effective or you're
simply gonna be coding with blinders on?

79
00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.090
这些是 JavaScript 语言的三大核心支柱
So these are the three core pillars
of the JavaScript language and

80
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.488
大部分这些支柱都是在 10 天结束时发生的
largely all of these pillars were
in place at the end of the 10 day

81
00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.990
我和布伦达和我在 1995年的原型机
prototyping session that Brenda and
I put back in in 1995.

82
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.350
这主要是我们 24 年来所使用的 JavaScript 。
This is largely the JavaScript
that we've had now for 24 years.

83
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.040
是的，确实有不同的细节。
Yes, there are definitely
different details.

84
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.589
但很多东西都是核心的
But many of these things are as core and

85
00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.620
以语言为基础的基础。
root of a foundation as
it gets in the language.

86
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.779
在这一过程结束的过程中，为期大约两天的时间，
At the end of this course which will
cover over a period of about two days,

87
00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.550
就会有更多像我们五岁以上的感觉
it's going to feel a lot more
like we just went over five or

88
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.129
非常压缩的 10 天的材料
ten days worth of material because
it's extremely compressed.

89
00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.410
所以我并不是说你就在这个课程的最后，说，我是经过认证的，
So I don't mean for you to come at the end
of this course and say, aha I'm certified,

90
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.649
我知道关于 JavaScript 的所有事情都是关于 JavaScript的
I know everything there is to know about
JavaScript, this is not the end but

91
00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:30.529
开首
the beginning of what for

92
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.980
我已经完成了 20 年的旅程去了解 JavaScript。
me has been over a 20 year
journey to understand JavaScript.

93
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.439
我正在为你记录我对地图的了解
And I'm documenting for
you what I've figured out about the map.

94
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.560
我尝试为我的旅程建立一个藏宝图
I've tried to put together
a treasure map for my journey.

95
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.990
我正在为你记录这些书，这也是书的内容。
And I'm documenting that for you,
that's also what the books are.

96
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.409
所以把那些伴们用在这里
So use those as companions here.

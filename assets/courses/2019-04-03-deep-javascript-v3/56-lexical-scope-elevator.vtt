&gt；&gt；Kyle：我多年来一直使用的一个隐喻，它对我很有效
&gt;&gt; Kyle: One metaphor that I have used for years that works well for me and

2
00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.256
也许会对你有好处。
maybe will work well for you.

3
00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:11.221
作用域相互嵌套的概念类似于建筑物
This idea of scopes being nested within each other is similar to a building

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.794
里面有个又大又高的电梯，好吗？
with a big tall elevator in it, okay?

5
00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.544
想象一下，如果你走进一栋大楼，你正在寻找什么，但是
Imagine if you went into a building and you were looking for something but

6
00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:17.728
你不知道它在哪里。
you didn't know where it was.

7
00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.410
你只是知道它在大楼里的某个地方或者
You just knew it was somewhere in the building or

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.763
可能在大楼的某个地方。
probably somewhere in the building.

9
00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.614
你应该从一楼开始。
You'd start on the first floor.

10
00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:24.260
你只需要做一个基本的线性搜索。
You just do basically a linear search.

11
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.975
从一楼开始，在那里找。
Start on the first floor, look for it there.

12
00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.766
如果你找不到，就乘电梯到下一层，
And if you don't find it, take the elevator to the next floor,

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.615
在那里找找。
look for it there.

14
00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:31.800
如果你找不到，那就一遍又一遍地做。
If you don't find it, do that again and again and again.

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.697
最终你会到达大楼的顶层。
And eventually you're gonna arrive at the top floor of the building.

16
00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:39.932
你要么找到它，要么找不到，但没有别的地方可去。
And you either find it or you don't, but there's nowhere else to go.

17
00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:44.719
所以从概念上讲，一楼是我们目前的范围，
So conceptually the first floor is our current scope where the reference is,

18
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.087
顶层是全球范围。
and the top floor is the global scope.

19
00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:53.795
&gt；&gt；Kyle：我们稍后会在课程中回到这个比喻。
&gt;&gt; Kyle: We'll come back to this metaphor a later time in the course.

20
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.832
所以如果这对你有用的话就把它留在你的脑子里，
So just kinda keep that in your head if that works for you,

21
00:00:56.832 --> 00:00:59.000
一次爬一层楼的想法。
this idea of going one floor up at a time.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.173
我们不会立即跳到全球范围，我们只是一次走一层楼。
We don't immediately jump to the global scope, we just go one floor at a time.

>> 凯尔: 我多年来一直用一个比喻为我工作
&gt;&gt; Kyle: One metaphor that I have used for
years that works well for me and

2
00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.256
也许能为你做得好
maybe will work well for you.

3
00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:11.221
嵌套在彼此之间的作用域的概念与建筑物相似
This idea of scopes being nested within
each other is similar to a building

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.794
电梯里有个大电梯好吗
with a big tall elevator in it, okay?

5
00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.544
想象一下如果你去了一栋楼而你在找东西
Imagine if you went into a building and
you were looking for something but

6
00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:17.728
你不知道那是什么地方
you didn't know where it was.

7
00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.410
你就知道是在大楼里的某个地方
You just knew it was
somewhere in the building or

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.763
大概是在这栋楼的某个地方
probably somewhere in the building.

9
00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.614
你先从第一层开始
You'd start on the first floor.

10
00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:24.260
你只是做个线性搜索
You just do basically a linear search.

11
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.975
从第一层开始，在那里寻找。
Start on the first floor,
look for it there.

12
00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.766
如果你找不到它把电梯到下一层
And if you don't find it,
take the elevator to the next floor,

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.615
在那儿找
look for it there.

14
00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:31.800
如果你找不到它再一次重复一次
If you don't find it,
do that again and again and again.

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.697
最终你会到达建筑物的顶层
And eventually you're gonna arrive
at the top floor of the building.

16
00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:39.932
要么你要么找到要么不去但是没有别的地方可以去了
And you either find it or you don't,
but there's nowhere else to go.

17
00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:44.719
所以从概念上来说，第一层是我们目前的范围，
So conceptually the first floor is our
current scope where the reference is,

18
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.087
顶楼是全球范围
and the top floor is the global scope.

19
00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:53.795
>> 凯尔: 我们稍后会回到这个比喻。
&gt;&gt; Kyle: We'll come back to this
metaphor a later time in the course.

20
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.832
所以如果你想的话就把它放在你的脑袋里
So just kinda keep that in your
head if that works for you,

21
00:00:56.832 --> 00:00:59.000
一次一个楼层的想法
this idea of going one floor up at a time.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.173
我们不直接跳到全球范围，我们只需要一次发言。
We don't immediately jump to the global
scope, we just go one floor at a time.

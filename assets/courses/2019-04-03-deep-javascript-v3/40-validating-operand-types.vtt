>> Kyle Simpson: 我认为在 TypeScript 中被低估的一件事是
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: One thing that I think
is undervalued within TypeScript this is

2
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.879
其实我的很多虫子都是从那里来的
actually where many more
of my bugs have come from.

3
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.970
除了能让静态打字的信息
It's that in addition to being able
to a static typing information about

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.910
变量赋值，也可以告诉我们某些操作将无效。
variable assignments, it can also tell us
that certain operations would be invalid.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.300
在此特定情况下，它表示您不能从数字中减去字符串。
In this particular case, it's saying you
can't subtract a string from a number.

6
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.719
因为这种偏好是说不允许这种胁迫，
Because that particular preference is
saying don't allow that coercion, and

7
00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.789
在这件案子里对我来说是个有用的帮助
in this particular case,
that would be a really useful help for me.

8
00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.030
我真的很想
I would really like for

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.700
告诉我不要试图从数字中减去字符串
a linter to tell me, don't try to
subtract a string from a number.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.250
我最喜欢的是一个让我有这种感觉的
What I'd really like is a linter
that let me have that, but

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.469
不允许我对所有静态类型的赋值都有任何抱怨。
not let me have all the complaints
about all my static type assignments.

12
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.859
那是我的选择
That would be my preference.

13
00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.039
但我认为这一问题被低估了。
But this is, I think,
an undervalued part of what they do.

14
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.979
他们实际上允许我们检查那些
Is that they are actually allowing
us to check the operations that

15
00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.384
我们在做我们大部分的商业逻辑
we're doing where most of
our business logic is, and

16
00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:55.478
确保这些操作有效。
making sure that those
operations are valid.

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
如果 TypeScript 有一些机制，您可以允许
It would be nice if TypeScript would have
some mechanism by which you could allow

18
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.179
就会有更多的压力发生
some more coercion to occur.

19
00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.584
因为有很多地方，我已经说过了，
Because there are plenty of places,
as I've already made the case,

20
00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:10.474
我想在那里做高压和其他地方我想避免的地方
where I'd like to be able to do coercion
and other Places I'd like to avoid it.

21
00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:14.085
在我的研究中，我认为 Typescript 是什么都没有。
It appears to me in my research that
Typescript is kind of all or nothing.

22
00:01:14.085 --> 00:01:17.765
你选择进入它或者你不选择它
You opt into it or you don't opt into it.

23
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.396
我更希望能有更多的裸体和配置
I'd prefer there to be more nuance and
configuration.

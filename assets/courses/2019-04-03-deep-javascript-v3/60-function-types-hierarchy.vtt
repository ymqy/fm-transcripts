>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 让我们总结一下我们的想法，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
let's summarize our thoughts on,

2
00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.580
或者我跟你分享的想法
or my thoughts that I've shared with you,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.699
我想我应该说的是他们不同类型的功能
I guess I should say, on functions
of their various different types.

4
00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.244
我认为功能宣言有一些
It is my opinion that function
declarations have some

5
00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:15.749
对他们有优越感
superiority to them.

6
00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.821
我们甚至还没谈过那些事我们会回到他们的时候
We haven't even talked about all of those,
we'll come back to those when we get to,

7
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.589
比如说在后面浪费时间
for example, wasting, later.

8
00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:27.609
但是，函数声明对指定的函数表达式有一些好处。
But a function declaration has some
benefits over a named function expression.

9
00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.550
但是命名函数表达式对于
But named function expressions
have huge benefits over

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.310
匿名函数表达式。
anonymous function expressions.

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.229
所以我觉得第二个比前两个要强烈得多，
So I feel much more strongly about the
second two of these than the first two,

12
00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.509
尽管我也喜欢命名函数声明
even though I also do tend to prefer
the named function declarations.

13
00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.406
所以这才是我们要知道的
So it's just something to be aware of,

14
00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:47.039
因为这不是真的很容易和快速的规则
because this isn't really something
that can be such a hard and fast rule.

15
00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.837
你得看看各种不同的情况。
You do have to look at
the various different cases.

16
00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:54.546
我当然明白为什么人们会用箭头
And I certainly understand why
people might use an arrow function

17
00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.850
当五个字符翻倍时
when it's five characters
doubling some variable.

18
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.780
但即使在那些你被诱惑去拯救一段时间的情况下
But even in those cases where you're
tempted just to save a little bit of time,

19
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.989
我还是会说名字翻倍
I would still argue that the name,
double it,

20
00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:11.620
比看 X 乘以 2更直接
tells me something more directly
than looking at x times 2.

21
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.170
所以我只想让你考虑更大的目的
So I just want you to consider that
bigger purpose, which is we want to

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.629
我们的密码能尽可能有效地沟通哪怕一眼
have our code communicate as effectively
as possible, even at a glance,

23
00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:25.039
不需要有人读和读一些代码
without somebody having to read and
sort of mentally execute some code and

24
00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.730
了解它的工作方式，或考虑对其进行任何类型的处理。
figure out what it does, or
consider any sort of corner cases on it.

25
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.520
我们不希望读者要做这些事情，理想的是。
We don't want the reader to have
to do those things, ideally.

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.530
我们希望他们能阅读我们的代码
We want them to be able
to read our code and

27
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859
了解它的目的几乎是一瞥
understand it's purpose
almost at a glance.

28
00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.152
因此，这些都是我喜欢按此顺序执行功能的原因，并且
So those are the reasons why I prefer
the functions in this order, and

29
00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:44.777
我会努力工作下去我基本上只会
I would work my way down, and
I would essentially only ever

30
00:01:44.777 --> 00:01:49.076
以箭头表达式形式执行匿名函数表达式。
do the anonymous function expression
in the arrow expression form.

31
00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:52.924
在那个特殊的情况下我只会这样做因为我在做词法
And in that one particular case, I would
only do so because I was getting lexical

32
00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:55.581
单击，稍后我们将会讨论这个问题。
clicks, which we'll talk
about later in the course.

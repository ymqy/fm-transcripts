00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.470
>> 演讲者 1: 好奇 " JSDoc " 或 " JSDoc " 之类的角色
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Curious what the role
of something like JSDoc or

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.719
其他表示法标准。
other notation standards are.

3
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:09.121
听起来好像是机器写代码的问题
It kinda sounds like there's the issue
of writing code for the machine and

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.390
然后写密码给那些要在路上读几个星期的人
then writing code for the humans who
have to read it weeks down the road.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:20.734
我对使用明确的胁迫的说法很有意见
And I'm very persuaded by the arguments
about using explicit coercion,

6
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:25.629
但在其他情况下，您遇到或
but are there other cases
where you have encountered or

7
00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.390
会推荐类似的战术吗
would recommend ancillary
tactics like that?

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.500
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 嗯，我当然认为，如果你仔细想想编码，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well, I certainly think
if you think about coding on the whole,

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.579
顺便说下这是个大问题
it's a great question, by the way.

10
00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.130
如果你想以完整的方式来表达我的想法
If you think about coding on the whole
as a way to communicate my ideas,

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.320
然后有很多方法来交流想法。
then there are lots of
ways to communicate ideas.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
其中一个方法是在您编写的代码中，其中一个方法在辅助操作中。
One of the ways is in the code that you
write, one of the ways is in the ancillary

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.840
您提到的内容，例如，代码注释。
stuff that you mentioned,
like for example code comments.

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.725
现在有人告诉你，你不该有代码评论，
Now some people tell you,
nah you should never need code comments,

15
00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.640
代码应该自我解释。
code should explain itself.

16
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.659
您不应更依赖代码注释而不是代码注释。
You should not have more reliance
upon code comments than the code.

17
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.292
我看到的是这样的代码库，就是这样。
And I've seen code bases that
are like that, that are so

18
00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:08.780
在没有代码注释的情况下无法将其计算出来。
inscrutable that without the code comment,
nobody's figuring it out.

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.870
但是，代码注释不是要避免的坏事。
But code comments are not
a bad thing to be avoided.

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.549
他们没有暴露计划的弱点
They're not exposing some
weakness of the program.

21
00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.049
这是代码注释的问题。
Here's the problem with code comments.

22
00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.655
人们写他们的代码评论我很抱歉
People write the what in their
code comment, I'm sorry,

23
00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:23.680
他们会写代码注释的方式
they write the how in their code comment.

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.920
就像你有一条线说， i++ ，
Like you have a line that says, i++, and

25
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.829
然后你说点增量 i 就是代码注释。
then you say something like
increment i is the code comment.

26
00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.560
我知道是递增 i 我能看出来
I know it's incrementing i,
I can see that.

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.740
这就是我想让密码告诉我的原因
Here's what I want the code
comment to tell me, why.

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.085
为什么需要递增，以及为什么只有 1，为什么不需要 2 或 12?
Why do you need to increment, and
why only by 1, why not by 2 or 12?

29
00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:45.109
告诉我为什么有时告诉我怎么做
Tell me why, and
sometimes maybe tell me how.

30
00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.240
但是别告诉我密码是什么
But don't tell me what,
that's what the code's for.

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.450
因此，您可以很好地与代码进行沟通。
So yes,
you can communicate well with your code.

32
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.572
如果您在此功能上做了 JS 文档，那么这两个参数也会接收到
If you did a JS doc on this function and
said, these two parameters receive either

33
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:57.331
你对每个人都很清楚
strings or numbers, then you're very
clearly signaling to everybody,

34
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:59.409
都知道可能发生了某种胁迫
be aware that some coercion may happen.

35
00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.367
但这只是字符串和数字之间的关系，所以我们知道
But it's only between strings and
numbers, and so we know we

36
00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:07.230
缩小了我们所需要关注的角落案件的范围
have narrowed down the scope of corner
cases that we need to be concerned about.

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.509
当然，代码注释很有用，我不会完全依赖它们。
Absolutely, code comments can be useful,
I wouldn't rely entirely on them.

38
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.240
我认为在我们的代码中有很多事情是显而易见的。
I think there's lots of things we
can do in our code to be obvious.

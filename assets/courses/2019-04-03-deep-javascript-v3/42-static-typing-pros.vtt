00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.084
>> 凯尔 - 辛普森: 所以要理解我希望在这件事上
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So to understand that
thing that I would like there to be in

2
00:00:03.084 --> 00:00:06.878
中间是我们所面对的所有难题
the middle, the all or nothing sort
of conundrum that we're facing,

3
00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:10.960
我想更具体地挖掘这些利弊
I wanna dig into those pros and
cons a little bit more specifically.

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.560
这只是我对利弊的考虑，这不是一个客观的清单。
These are just my takes on the pros and
cons, this is not some objective list.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.652
第一，我认为一个关于 TypeScript 和 Flow 之类的系统的重要优点之一，
Number one, I think one of the big pros
about systems like TypeScript and Flow,

6
00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:25.292
我之前说过，他们把你的代码中的类型变得更加明显。
I said this earlier, they make the types
much more obvious in your code.

7
00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.789
这是一个很大的进步。
And that's a big improvement.

8
00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.357
对写代码有很大的改进本质上是完全不确定的
A big improvement over writing code
that's essentially completely uncertain,

9
00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:36.369
这特别行动会发生什么
unascertainable what's gonna happen
with this particular operation.

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.049
使这些类型变得显而易见是一件好事。
Making those types
obvious is a good thing.

11
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:46.710
这也是 TypeScript 的设计和
It's also a very strong positive
that the design of TypeScript and

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.799
流，放一个双关语，流，
Flow, to put a pun here,
goes with the flow,

13
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.920
如果你愿意的话，静态打字的方式就会有很多其他的语言。
if you will, of the way static typing
works in a lot of other languages.

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.738
语法非常相似。
The syntaxes are very similar.

15
00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:59.709
因此有强烈的熟悉感。
And so
there's a strong sense of familiarity.

16
00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.277
当你出现这种情况的时候你不是完全不同的
When you show up to something like that,
you're not in this entirely different

17
00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:05.790
你以前做过的人都比你还多
world than you've ever
done with types before.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.739
感觉很像你从一个更
It feels very much like the types
that you have from a more

19
00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.750
典型类型的语言，如 Java 或 C++ 。
typically typed language,
like a Java or C++.

20
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.430
因此熟悉的人很专业，我确信那是他们设计的一部分。
So the familiarity is a strong pro, and
I'm sure that was part of their design.

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.034
他们非常受欢迎。
They are extremely popular.

22
00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:25.799
这是不可否认的，尤其是 TypeScript 的受欢迎程度。
It's undeniable the popularity,
especially of TypeScript.

23
00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.519
好像我们每天都在宣布一些新的主要开放源
It seems like everyday we get an
announcement of some new major open source

24
00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:32.710
完全转换为 TypeScript的项目。
project that's completely
converting over to TypeScript.

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.527
就像在社区里建立起的低能曲线
And just like the hype curves that build
up in the community behind something

26
00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:42.641
就像一个 " 雷法 " 或 " 维 " ，他们以强大的方式建立起来，有很大的支持，
like a React or a Vue, they've built up
in such a strong way, with a big backing,

27
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:46.650
来自 Microsoft的 TypeScript ，流来自 Facebook。
TypeScript being from Microsoft,
Flow being from Facebook.

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.388
他们和社区建立了这么大的关系
They've built up in such a big
way with the community and

29
00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:52.651
背后的企业支持，投资学习和
the corporate support behind it,
that the investment to learn and

30
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:56.810
进入其中一个将会是一个长期回报的投资
get into one of those is gonna be an
investment that pays off for a long time.

31
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.530
这不是什么 fad 下周就要走了
It's not some fad that's
gonna go away next week.

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.030
因此，民望是一件很有力的诉讼。
So the popularity is a strong suit.

33
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.774
这背后有一个很大的社区一个文件
There's a big community behind it,
a ton of documentation,

34
00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:09.170
这些项目背后的势头是很重要的，这确实是有道理的。
a ton of momentum behind these projects,
and it certainly does make sense.

35
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.503
事实上，我绝对会说，我喜欢不喜欢打人，
In fact, I would absolutely say,
whether I liked TypeScript or not,

36
00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:16.882
如果你在一个系统里工作对我来说太傻了
it would be silly to me for
you to be working in a system,

37
00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:21.800
说你在微软 .NET 商店工作你每天都在后台写 C#
say you worked in a Microsoft .NET shop
and you wrote C# all day on the backend,

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.199
然后你就需要做些 JavaScript
and then you needed to do some JavaScript.

39
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.453
我无法想象你不会使用 TypeScript的情况。
I can't imagine a scenario where
you wouldn't use TypeScript.

40
00:02:28.453 --> 00:02:32.177
从精神的角度来说我已经在世界上
Cuz the mental context switching of,
I've been in types world and

41
00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:35.979
我现在在非类型的世界里对我来说太疯狂了
now I'm in non-types world,
would be nuts to me.

42
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.966
因此，在这方面，有很多场景是有道理的。
So there's lots of scenarios
where it makes completes sense.

43
00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.979
这就是为什么它生长的原因。
And the popularity of that,
that's the reason why it's growing.

44
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.639
而且它们很复杂，使它们真正擅长做什么。
And they're very sophisticated, and that
makes them really good at what they do.

45
00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.711
其实我很惊讶像 TypeScript 之类的东西
I'm actually kind of amazed at how
much something like TypeScript or

46
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:55.991
流可以推断我甚至故意模糊的代码
Flow can infer from code that I even
intentionally try to obfuscate, and

47
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:58.879
他们还能找到这些东西
they're still able to
figure those things out.

48
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.009
这些工具太棒了
These tools are fantastic at that.

49
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:07.770
这些都是很有好处的，但我也有一些负面的负面因素。
So these are all strong pros, but I also
have some strong negatives against them.

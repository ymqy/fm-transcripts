00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.189
威尔: 你知道吗？ 是结对编程的时候了,
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: You know what?
It is pair programming, it's time,

2
00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.679
我们的节奏很好很好,
we're taking this very nicely paced,
it's wonderful,

3
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.919
我们要做一些结对编程，伙计们。
we're gonna do some pair programming,
folks.

4
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.189
我觉得现在回到原来的舞伴身边,
I think at this point,
get back back with your same partners,

5
00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.050
去 csbin.io/closures 你会看到我们在这里做了什么
go to csbin.io/closures and
you're gonna see what we did here, and

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.530
你会看到一大堆关闭的挑战。
you're gonna start to see a whole
bunch of closure challenges.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.530
在20分钟的结对编程会议之后,
Right after a 20 minute
pair programming session,

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.429
我们会一起回来，看看结局如何
we're gonna come back together and
we're gonna see how closure works

9
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.179
我们说的是词汇范围。
under the hood and
we're talking lexical scoping.

10
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.700
我要告诉你们一个五个字母的单词，而不是一个五个字母的单词，单词短语
I'm going to tell you the one five letter
word, not a word five, word phrase that

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.880
威尔，我不会再开这个玩笑了，因为显然有人对此很不高兴
will, I'm not to make this joke anymore
because somebody apparently was upset that

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.104
他们知道这个词，肯定不会得到高级开发人员的职位。
it definitely did not get them a senior
developer job for knowing this phrase.

13
00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:42.859
说话人2: (笑)威尔 · 森塔斯: 那么，如果你知道
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So but if you know

14
00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.789
这句话，你会得到这样的高级开发工作，我想保证
this phrase, you will get a senior
developer job like that, I want to promise

15
00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.780
你现在只要说出这五个字，你就会在另一个国家看到。
you right now you say those five words,
you're gonna see it in another country.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.170
好了，回到结对编程。
All right, back to pair programming.

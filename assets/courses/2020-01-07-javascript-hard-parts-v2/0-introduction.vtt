00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.549
威尔 · 森特斯: 今天,
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Today,

2
00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:05.129
我们要学习硬件原始课程的第二个版本。
we are gonna cover a version two
of the Hard Parts original course.

3
00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.509
接下来，我们将讨论 JavaScript 的五个主要方面。
With that, we're gonna go through
five big areas of JavaScript.

4
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.586
我认为所有的基础部分。
I think all the foundational pieces.

5
00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:13.589
首先，只是基本的 JavaScript 原则。
Firstly, just underlying
JavaScript principles.

6
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.939
代码实际上是如何在 JavaScript 中运行的？
How does code actually run in JavaScript?

7
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.239
其次，函数式编程的一个关键部分,
Secondly, a key part of
functional programming,

8
00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.856
高阶函数和回调函数。
higher order functions and callbacks.

9
00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:26.553
第三，闭包，对我来说，JavaScript 最优雅、最美丽的特性。
Third, closure, to me the most elegant and
beautiful feature of JavaScript.

10
00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:30.149
如果你真的想清楚了，就要从一开始就真正理解它
The bit that if you get your head around
truly, truly understand it from first

11
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.869
你可以理解 JavaScript 引擎的许多核心部分。
principles, you understand many of
the core pieces of the JavaScript engine.

12
00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.756
我喜欢这部分。
I love this part.

13
00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:38.777
然后是类和原型，这意味着 OOP。
Then classes and
prototypes, that means OOP.

14
00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:43.338
这里的目标是，我们可以成长为问题解决者的代码，这样
The goal here is can we grow as
problem solvers with code such that

15
00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:47.770
我们可以自主应对未来的挑战吗？
we're autonomous in our future
wrestling with challenges?

16
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.490
要做到这一点，我的信念是
Now to do that, my conviction is

17
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.929
你需要尽可能全面地理解 JavaScript。
you want to understand JavaScript
under the hood as fully as possible.

18
00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.979
你越是了解它是如何发挥出组件，然后
The more you understand how it's playing
out of the component pieces, then

19
00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.500
你可以利用这些知识的原子来解决高层次的问题。
you can bring those atoms of knowledge to
bear to solve a problem at a high level.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.640
现在，我也认为，它不仅使你成为一个伟大的高级工程师，事实上,
Now, I also argue that not only does it
make you a great senior engineer, in fact,

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.590
这是我的要求。
here's my claim.

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.444
初级工程师采用任何他们交给建造的特性。
Junior engineer takes any
feature they're given to build.

23
00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:17.180
如果他们以前见过技术或者解决方案，他们可以解决它。
And if they've seen technology or maybe
the solution before, they can solve it.

24
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.762
中级工程师采用任何他们被赋予的特性来构建。
Mid-level engineer takes any
feature they're given to build.

25
00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:24.271
即使他们以前没有见过这种技术或解决方案，他们也可以
And even if they've not seen the
technology or solution before, they can

26
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.531
因为他们学会了如何学习，他们解决问题的能力很强。
figure it out because they've learned how
to learn, they're problem solving strong.

27
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:33.114
高级工程师是那些可以利用任何特定功能的人，而不仅仅是
A senior engineer is somebody who can
take any given feature, and not only just

28
00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:37.709
自己解决问题，但要让团队的其他人自己解决问题。
figure out for themselves, but enable
the rest of their team to figure it out.

29
00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.406
因为他们有技术交流，能够解释他们的代码是什么
Because they have technical communication,
the ability to explain what their code is

30
00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:46.156
以一种清晰而热诚的方式，对他们团队中的其他人做了什么。
doing to somebody else in their team,
in a clear and cordial manner.

31
00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:49.838
但我也要说，即使是初级的中级开发人员,
But I'd also say even for
junior mid-level developers,

32
00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:54.058
技术交流会让你的思维更清晰。
technical communication is gonna
make your own mindset clearer.

33
00:01:54.058 --> 00:01:58.399
所以硬件部分的目的可能会因为你的背景而有所不同
So the purpose of Hard Parts is gonna
differ depending maybe on your background

34
00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.740
在 JavaScript 中。
in JavaScript.

35
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.150
如果你是一个中高级开发人员，你已经见过很多这样的例子
If you're someone who's a mid-senior
developer, you've seen many of these

36
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.420
也许你有计算机科学的背景。
principles before, maybe you've come
from a computer science background.

37
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.539
然后想想 JavaScript 的早期部分,
Then think of especially
the earlier parts of JavaScript,

38
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.789
更多的是关于建立你的技术交流。
the Hard Parts, as more about building
up your technical communication.

39
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:15.652
这种能力
The ability for

40
00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:20.171
把黑板上正在发生的事情用口头表达出来,
you to verbally work through exactly
what's happening on the blackboard here,

41
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:24.765
用清晰和精确的语言来描述你的 JavaScript 和代码。
verbally talk through your JavaScript and
your code with clarity and precision.

42
00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:30.350
这不仅会提高你作为一个工程师的推理能力，而且还会
That's not only going to improve the way
you reason as an engineer, it's also gonna

43
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.122
让你在工程项目上成为一个更有效率，更具合作精神的团队成员。
make you a more effective, collaborative
team member on your engineering projects.

44
00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:39.349
你现在可以把复杂性变得突出或者
You're gonna now be able to take
complexity and make it salient or

45
00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.270
对你团队中的其他开发人员有意义。
meaningful to other
developers in your team.

46
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.949
如果你不熟悉这些真正相当困难的原则下
If you're not as familiar with some of
these really quite hard principles under

47
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.289
的引擎盖，然后它会给你提供一些
the hood of JavaScript,
then it's gonna provide you some of

48
00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.120
能让你成为更好的问题解决者的基石。
the building blocks that is gonna allow
you to become a better problem solver.

49
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.070
我们将深入到 JavaScript 的背后，在幕后。
We're gonna go under the hood of
JavaScript, behind the scenes.

50
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.995
看看所有的部件如何从原型链，所有的方式到
See how all the pieces from the prototype
chain, all the way through to

51
00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:07.354
词法作用域、事件循环、微任务和回调队列。
lexical scoping, to the event loop and
the micro task and callback queues.

52
00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:12.159
为了给我们自己的特色，承诺是如何在引擎盖下工作的
To how promises are working under the hood
in order to give ourselves the features

53
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.822
以及知识的单位，我们可以利用的知识的原子
and the units of knowledge, the kinda
atoms of knowledge that we can then wield

54
00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.199
更灵活地解决问题。
to solve problems more flexibly.

55
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.090
当我们一起参观工作室的时候,
As we go through the workshop together,

56
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.259
我们要看看这些部分是如何组合在一起的，从我们的平台开始。
we're gonna see how these pieces come
together, build up from our platform.

57
00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:29.319
我们将从工作和理解的节奏开始,
We'll start with a measured pace
in our jobs and understandings,

58
00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.599
如果我们注重更多的经验，注重技术沟通,
if we focus on more experience,
focus on the technical communication,

59
00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.360
从这个共享的理解平台上建立起更难的部分。
building up to ever harder pieces from
that shared platform of understanding.

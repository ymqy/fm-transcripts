&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：那么我们对发电机的感觉如何？让我们尝试一下练习和
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So how are we feeling about generator Let's try an exercise and

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.990
看看我们对发电机的感觉。
see how we're feeling about generators.

4
00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:16.050
我们要再去一次，再回到井里去一次。
We're gonna go one more time, deep back in the well one more time.

5
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.079
我们已经有的这个并行进行三个调用的运行示例
This running example that we've had of making the three calls in parallel and

6
00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.140
排序他们的反应。
sequencing their responses.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.350
我迫不及待地想让你看到发电机的解决方案有多酷。
I cannot wait for you to see how cool the solution is with generators.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.969
这对我来说是最难做的事，再等十分钟你再试一试，
This is the hardest thing for me to do, to wait ten more minutes while you try it,

9
00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.229
因为我现在只想给你看。
cuz I just wanna show it to you right now.

10
00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.170
但我想给你一个机会来练习思考发电机的方式
But I wanna give you a chance to practice thinking about generators the way I

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
刚才说的，试着看看你能不能把你的大脑包围起来。
just talked about, try to see if you can get your brain wrapped around.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.560
我会怎么做并行的事情，然后等待
How would I do things in parallel, but then wait for

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.329
对他们的输出进行排序？
them to sequence their output?

14
00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.780
所以试着用发电机练习七。
So try exercise seven with a generator.

15
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.040
您可以使用序列来运行它，因为这非常方便，
You can use a sequence to run it cuz that's pretty convenient,

16
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.329
它已经包含在那里了。
it's already included there for you.

17
00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.530
最后五个或
The last five or

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.960
六张幻灯片应该有足够的信息来帮助你。
six slides should have more than enough info to help you with that.

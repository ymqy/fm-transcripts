00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:07.030
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：那么，让我们用链条中的承诺来练习。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So let's practice with promises in a chain.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.580
我们要回到以前做过的同样的练习。
We're gonna go back to the same exercise that we did before.

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.320
我要你打开第三个练习，我想给你一个提示，
I want you to open up exercise three, and I want to give you the hint that,

5
00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.169
有点像我们在练习二中所做的，getFile产生了一些东西，
kind of like what we did in exercise two where getFile produced something,

6
00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.879
现在getFile需要产生一个承诺。
now getFile is going to need to produce a promise.

7
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.275
所以我们仍然要调用getFile三次。
So we're still gonna call getFile three times.

8
00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:30.230
一个用于文件一，一个用于文件二，一个用于文件三。
One for file one one for file two one for file three.

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.590
我们会得到三个承诺，这是最容易的部分。
We're gonna get three promises back, that's the easy part.

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.119
我免费给你。
I'll give you that for free.

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.950
但现在你的任务是使用我刚刚教给你的
But now your task is using what I just taught you about

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.549
承诺是如何被锁在一起的。
how promises chained together.

13
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.320
你打算如何对这些承诺的回应进行排序？
How are you going to sequence the responses to those promises?

14
00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.200
我们对它们进行排序的方式是将它们嵌套在一起，
In thumps the way we sequenced them was to nest them together,

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.469
但我们如何将承诺排在一起呢？
but how do we sequence promises together?

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.600
我刚刚教过你，回去看看那些幻灯片，试着练习三。
I just taught you to, go back and look at those slides and try exercise three.

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.829
只是为了确保我们在同一页上，让我打开它
Just so we make sure we're on the same page, let me open that up just so

18
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.240
你可以看到我们在说什么。
you can see what we're talking about.

19
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.829
练习三，这个getFile就在第22行，
Exercise three, this getFile right here on line 22,

20
00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.710
这就是你需要为正在发生的事情做出承诺的地方。
that's where you need to produce a promise for what's happening.

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.519
然后我们仍然会调用getFile函数三次，然后
And then we're gonna still call the getFile function three times, and

22
00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.799
然后我们要把这些承诺排在一起。
then we're gonna sequence those promises together.

23
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.420
所以让我给你五六分钟来试一试。
So let me give you five or six minutes to try your hand at that.

24
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.701
回去看看我刚才给你们看的最后五六张幻灯片。
Go back and look at the last five or six slides that I just showed you.

25
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.143
他们会告诉你如何做到这一点，所有这些步骤。
They're gonna tell you exactly how to accomplish that, all of those steps.

26
00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.640
看看你能想出什么，然后我们几分钟后再谈。
And see what you can come up with and then we'll talk about that in a few minutes.

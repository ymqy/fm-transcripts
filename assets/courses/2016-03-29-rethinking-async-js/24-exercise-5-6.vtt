00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:05.076
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：接下来的两个练习，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The next two exercises,

3
00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:08.359
我实际上要一起布置练习五和练习六。
I'm actually gonna assign exercise five and six together.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.980
他们是这样的，练习五和练习三完全一样。
And here's what they are, exercise five is exactly the same thing as exercise three.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.899
还记得我们做过承诺链吗？
Remember we did the promise chain?

6
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:21.510
但是现在练习五邀请你使用一个序列来创建一个链。
But now exercise five invites you to use a sequence to create a chain.

7
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:26.719
练习六和练习四完全一样，
Exercise six is exactly the same as exercise four,

8
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.579
我们做了地图绘制和减少。
where we did map and reduce.

9
00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.039
但它邀请您以循环方式使用序列，并且
But it invites you to use a sequence in a looping fashion, and

10
00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.590
你会发现这更容易做到。
you'll find out that it's easier to do.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.280
你甚至不需要减少，你可以用一个序列用两个贴图来做。
You don't even need to reduce, you can do it with two maps using a sequence.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.000
所以这两个练习都是为了给你一些时间让你变得更舒服
So both of those exercises are designed to give you some time to get more comfortable

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.100
与使用它的序列一起使用，以便我们可以在其余部分中使用它。
with a sequence using it, so that we can use it throughout the rest.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.417
我要说的是，基本上我们要做的就是停下来
I will say this, basically what we're gonna do is just stop for

15
00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.104
接下来的20分钟让你练习。
the next 20 minutes to let you work on the exercises.

16
00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:57.101
如果您已经熟悉一个序列，或者
If you're already familiar with a sequence, or

17
00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:01.712
如果你真的不关心它，那就把这两个练习看作是可选的。
if you don't really care about it, consider the two exercises optional.

18
00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:04.504
但它们的设计目的是让你回去做你刚刚做的事情，但是
But they are designed to let you go back and do what you just did but

19
00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:07.230
用一个序列来使它变得更加熟悉。
with a sequence to kind to get more familiar with it.

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.579
因此，您应该能够比较三个和五个解决方案，并且
So you should be able to compare the solutions between three and five, and

21
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.905
四个和六个，非常直截了当。
four and six, pretty straightforwardly.

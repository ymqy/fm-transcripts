00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.149
>> Brian Holt: 现在所有这些都是我想给你看的
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now that all of that
is working together I wanna show you

2
00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.469
有些想法给你一些很酷的想法你现在可以做了
some like, give you some ideas of really
cool stuff you can do now that you have

3
00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:11.060
访问所有 CSS 和 JavaScript。
access to all the css and JavaScript.

4
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.710
这就是一个很好的例子。
So, a good example of that would be here.

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.579
这是所有 JavaScript ，所以我可以为所欲为。
This is all JavaScript, so
I can do whatever I want.

6
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:23.312
我可以说， >> Brian Holt: Const 颜色
I could say like,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Const color

7
00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:27.370
我不知道现在我们可以用粉色
equals I don't know, for
now we can make it like, pink.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.670
在这里，这是一个模板字符串，对吧 ?
And then here,
this is a template string, right?

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.334
所以我可以把 #333 放进去，把颜色放在那里，对吧 ?
So instead of having #333 there, I can
just put ${ and put color there, right?

10
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.679
>> Brian Holt: 看起来好一点，不是吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That looks
marginally better, doesn't it?

11
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:50.759
现在你可以看到你的线了，那看起来是粉红色的。
Now you can see your line, well,
that looks really pink up there.

12
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.350
但我的电脑很漂亮
But it's very nice looking on my computer.

13
00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.909
你能用 JavaScript做的任何事
So, anything that you
can do with JavaScript,

14
00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.159
现在你也可以在这里做了
you can now do in here now as well.

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.721
所以我可以做点什么让它发挥作用
So, I can do something like,
make this a function really quick,

16
00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.281
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And say return,

17
00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:25.436
>> Brian Holt: 让我们在这里做个挂钩
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just make a hook here

18
00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:28.512
真正快速的常量填充 =
really quick const padding =

19
00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:37.864
useState >> Brian Holt: And
useState
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

20
00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:42.125
这里我们说初步填料是 15吧
here we'll say the initial
padding will be 15, right?

21
00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:50.129
>> Brian Holt: 并设置填充，并在此处放置填充。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And set padding,
and we'll put padding here.

22
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.079
然后在这里的标题上
And then here, on the header,

23
00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.019
只要有人点击
anytime that someone clicks,

24
00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:06.909
加填充加 15 或
to setPadding of padding plus 15 or

25
00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.530
就像这样
something like that.

26
00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.105
这会让我们心烦心乱这不是件简单的问题
It's gonna be upset cuz this is not
a quick cuz this is not element, but

27
00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:16.973
我们只是来举个例子
again we're just here for examples.

28
00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:22.509
所以现在如果我刷新这个， >> Brian Holt: 我们的背景色，
So now if I refresh this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Our background color,

29
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.379
动物/p 背景色填充，我希望它只是填充。
animal/p background color padding,
I want it just to be padding.

30
00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.493
>> Brian Holt: Padding，这可以是， >> Brian Holt: Pink。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Padding, this can be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pink.

31
00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:40.719
>> Brian Holt: 我在这里搞砸了什么 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What did I mess up here?

32
00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.219
好的好的
Yeah, okay.

33
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.879
那么现在，如果我点击这个，请注意我每次点击它的时候，
So, now, if I click this,
notice that every time that I click it,

34
00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.479
它变得更加美丽和美丽
it gets more beautiful and more beautiful.

35
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.665
看他们会接吻的
Look, they're gonna kiss.

36
00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:04.838
[ LAUGH] 如果我的设计师妻子能看到我
[LAUGH] If my designer
wife could see me now

37
00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:10.629
她就会杀了我直说吧
she would just murder me,
just straight up.

38
00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.870
但我要指出的是这真的很酷
But the point stands here that this is
actually pretty cool that I commend it

39
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.719
以编程方式处理样式，对吗 ?
manipulate styles programmatically
like this, right?

40
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.247
这和 css 的关系有点难
This would have been a bit more
difficult to do with css and

41
00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:24.151
JavaScript 是非常独立的，对。
JavaScript being very separate, right.

42
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:27.272
但因为我们把一切都聚在一起了
But because we've mashed
everything together,

43
00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:30.623
我们对我们的东西有很大的控制
we get a lot of control over
what our stuff looks like.

44
00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:37.543
>> Brian Holt: 有任何问题吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

45
00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:44.247
>> Brian Holt: 如果要在生产应用程序中使用此产品，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to
use this in your production app,

46
00:03:44.247 --> 00:03:48.289
我给你设计的这个设计是值得欢迎的，就把它给我吧。
this design that I've made you
are welcome to, just attribute it to me.

47
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.838
这就是我想要的
That's all I want.

48
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:55.225
>> Brian Holt: 好的。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

49
00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:06.241
> > Brian Holt: 所以让我们来做我们的， >> Brian Holt: Poodle 稍大一点，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's make our,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Poodle a little bit bigger,

50
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:09.961
所以我要把 css equals css之类的
so I'm gonna put css equals css,
like that, and

51
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:14.971
我要我们的狮子狗要做字体 60px 之类的
I want our poodle to be font-size 60px,
something like that.

52
00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:21.581
> > Brian Holt: 所以我刚刚补充说，就在那，现在我们该过去了，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I just added that, right
there, and now we should go over here,

53
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:24.492
我们的狮子狗应该很开心
and our poodle should be nice and happy.

54
00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:34.409
> > Brian Holt: 好的，就在那部分， 17 到 19。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, just out of that
part right there, 17 through 19.

55
00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.500
所以，我不会说这不是为了大家，对吧 ?
So, again, I'm not gonna say if
this is not for everyone, right?

56
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.069
有些人只会发现我们甚至会考虑
Some people are just gonna find this
atrocious that we would even consider

57
00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.870
把这些东西都放在一起
putting these things all together.

58
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.560
但是让我给你几个好处
But let me give you a couple of
benefits beyond what I've shown you

59
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.079
有计划的方面
with the programmatic aspects of it.

60
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.420
如果我删除了 navbar ， CSS 就会用它，对。
Now if I ever delete navbar,
the CSS goes with it, right.

61
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.550
因为所有 CSS 都建在这个 navbar上。
Because all the CSS was
built into this navbar.

62
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.629
你们中有多少人在网站上工作只有 2 兆字节的 CSS
How many of you have worked on websites
where you just have 2 megabytes of CSS and

63
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.149
你主要使用的是 10% 但你不知道你能删除什么
you're primarily using 10% of it but
you don't know what you can delete.

64
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.189
我当然是对的
Me certainly me right.

65
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.110
当我加入 LinkedIn 时， LinkedIn 有 2 兆字节的 CSS。
LinkedIn when I joined LinkedIn
we had 2 megabytes of CSS.

66
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.160
谁知道我们到底在用多少钱，对吧 ?
And who knows how much that we
were actually using, right?

67
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.680
所以我喜欢用词组优化删除能力，对吧 ?
So I like to use the phrase optimize for
delete ability, right?

68
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.350
因为如果您要优化可删除的代码，那么如果您的代码是可删除的，
Because if you're optimizing for
deletable, if your code is deletable,

69
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.089
这就意味着它是模块式的对吧
that means it's modular, right?

70
00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.860
你可以把它拉出来整个塔都不会倒塌
That you can pull pieces out and the whole
tower doesn't come tumbling down.

71
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.199
这也是一个很大的好处。
So that's a big benefit as well.

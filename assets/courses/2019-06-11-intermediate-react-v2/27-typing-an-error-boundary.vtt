00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.294
>> Brian Holt: 让我们进行错误边界。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go do error boundary.

2
00:00:01.294 --> 00:00:08.083
因此，请重命名 ErrorBoundary.tsx。
So rename ErrorBoundary.tsx.

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.664
>> Brian Holt: 希望你在这里侦测到我刚重命名的模式
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And hopefully you're
sensing a pattern here that I just renamed

4
00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:16.800
文件我把问题解决了
the file, and I just fixed the problems.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.420
这就是这里的过程。
And that's just kind of the process here.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.670
我帮助将一个位于 LinkedIn 的代码库迁移到 typescript 中，并且
I helped to migrate one a the code bases
at LinkedIn to be in typescript, and

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.469
这就是我一个月来做的
that's literally what I did for a month.

8
00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.269
这就是重命名文件并解决问题。
That's just rename files and fix it.

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.320
问别人你在做什么
And ask people,
what the hell were you doing?

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.820
还是想
Or thinking?

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.909
那是我一般的工作
That's kind of my job in general.

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.609
所以我要把这个从一个有构造的人
So, I'm gonna move this from
being on a constructor to being

13
00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.179
公共类属性。
a public class property.

14
00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:48.469
你也完全可以这样做你可以通过
Again you totally could just do it like
this, and you could pass in what the state

15
00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.979
是，但是我喜欢把它做得更好。
is, but I like doing it as
public class properties better.

16
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.231
所以我要删除这个，并将它移到构造函数之外，
So I'm just going to delete that, and
move that outside of the constructor, and

17
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.228
删除构造函数。
delete the constructor.

18
00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.694
> > Brian Holt: 然后我们会说这是一个公共状态。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're
gonna say this is a public state.

19
00:01:02.694 --> 00:01:08.647
我们会说这是一个公共的静态
We're gonna say this is a public static,

20
00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:12.908
公共，公共和公共。
public, public and public.

21
00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:22.504
>> Brian Holt: 我们必须告诉它错误的确是错误，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have to tell it
that errors are indeed errors,

22
00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:25.640
信息为 ErrorInfo。
and the info is ErrorInfo.

23
00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:34.990
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it.

24
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.831
所有其他事物都能找到它是什么
Everything else it can
figure out what it is.

25
00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:45.650
> > Brian Holt: Great ，任何问题?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great, any questions?

26
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.646
这很容易
That was pretty easy.

27
00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:50.396
>> Brian Holt: 我认为这也是你会发现的。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's
what you'll find as well.

28
00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:52.591
所以，这就是我告诉人们想要搬上打字本的东西。
So, this is what I tell people
that wanna move to typescript.

29
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:56.319
我有个很棒的推文我晚点给你看
I actually have a really great
tweet that I'll show you later,

30
00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.959
把 typescript 迁移到痛苦的过程中你只是在质疑
that migrating the typescript is so
painful, and you're just questioning,

31
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.269
我为什么要这样折磨自己
why did I subject myself to this torture?

32
00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.300
直到你把你密码的 60% 用在打字员上
Until you get to about 60% of your
code's base being in typescript,

33
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.629
突然之间一切都很神奇
and then all of a sudden,
everything is magical.

34
00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.805
突然之间，这想法很棒，你是个天才。
All of a sudden, this was a fantastic
idea and you're a genius.

35
00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:17.069
这就是我的生活的故事
[LAUGH] That's kind of
the story of my life.

36
00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.199
我只是有点像个白痴一样上下
I just kinda go up and
down like I'm an idiot.

37
00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.860
然后我是个天才但大部分是白痴公园
And then I'm a genius,
but mostly the idiot park.

38
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.579
总之这不是和布莱恩的治疗
Anyway, this is not therapy with Brian.

39
00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.759
但我想说的是你会想知道
What I wanna say though, is there's gonna
be parts of this where you're gonna wonder

40
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.319
我为什么选择这样对自己
why did I choose to do this to myself?

41
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.389
付款人真的来了，你的代码大部分都是用打字员来的
And the payoff really comes once, most of
your code bases in typescript because then

42
00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:42.979
我想你的代码库会开始聚结
your code base will start kind of
coalescing into like coherence, I suppose.

43
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.543
而且很高兴你能从另一个团队里输入一个文件
And, it'll be nice like you can just
import a file from another team, and

44
00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.722
你可以看到它的所有类型和旧的类型的检查
you can see all the types in it,
and old type check all that stuff.

45
00:02:49.722 --> 00:02:50.629
这都是有道理的。
It all makes sense.

46
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.349
好吧
So, yeah.

47
00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.889
这就是我要说的，耐心一点。
That's what I would say,
just be patient a little bit.

48
00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.659
库兹你必须要经过很多时间才开始有任何意义
Cuz you have to get through a lot of
it before it starts making any sense.

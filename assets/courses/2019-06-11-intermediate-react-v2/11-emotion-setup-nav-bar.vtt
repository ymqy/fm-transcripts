00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.230
> > 布莱恩: 我想和你一起建造的东西是一个导航栏。
&gt;&gt; Brian: The thing that I want
to build with you is a nav bar.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.089
所以现在我们不像酒吧里的酒吧
So right now,
we don't have like a nav bar up here, but

3
00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.609
我们要和一个叫做 " E运动" 的工具一起建造一个
we're gonna build one together
with a tool called Emotion.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.580
现在，E运动是我们在 JS中称为 CSS 的一些东西。
Now, Emotion is something
that we would call CSS in JS,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.149
这很有争议取决于你问谁
which is very controversial
depending on who you ask.

6
00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:23.109
我认为，我认为 CSS 是很棒的，我很差劲。
I kind of reserve judgement that I
think CSS is great, and I'm bad at it.

7
00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.152
但在 JS 里， CSS 是一个非常有趣的事情。
But CSS in JS I think is
a very interesting thing.

8
00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:30.829
我认为E原议案是最具说服力的实施方式。
And I find Emotion to be the most
compelling implementation of it.

9
00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.299
在之前的课程中我教了造型的组件
In previous versions of this course,
I taught styled components,

10
00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.200
是另一个众所周知的
which is another well known one.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.990
但如果你在这一点上， Ewon 差不多赢了，它的大部分都是
But if you, at this point, Emotion
pretty much has won, it has most of

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920
它是最受欢迎的，最能表现的。
the developer mind share, it's the most
popular one, it's the most performant one.

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.350
所以，这绝对是一个，你应该考虑使用。
So, it's definitely one to,
you should probably think about using.

14
00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.591
好吧这样我就能用 JavaScript 来做我所有的造型
Okay, so it allows me to do all
of my styling in JavaScript and

15
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.012
没有任何单独的 CSS 文件。
not have any separate CSS files.

16
00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:57.612
但是它要做的就是把你的代码编译好
But what it will do is it
will compile your code so

17
00:00:57.612 --> 00:01:01.140
会有一个独立的 CSS 文件对吧
that there will be a separate CSS file,
right?

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.019
你最后还是要和 JS 和 CSS 文件一起
So, you still end up with JS and
CSS files at the end, but

19
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.259
你的所有石刑都把它都加起来了
it mushes everything together for
all of your stylings as well.

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.329
所以我现在要你做的第一件事就是
So the first thing I
want you to do now is I'm

21
00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.995
只会让我的服务器停停
gonna stop my server for just a second and

22
00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:24.349
我要说 npm install @emotion/core
I'm gonna say npm install @emotion/core,

23
00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:29.858
和 @emotion/babel - 预置-css-prop。
and @emotion/babel-preset-css-prop.

24
00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.750
好的，这实际上是给我们一个核心库，它将会运行。
Okay, so this is actually going to give
us the core library that's going to run.

25
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.656
Eball 的运行时间为千字节，根本不是很大。
The runtime for Emotion is a couple of
kilobytes, it's not very big at all.

26
00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:41.033
然后这个 babel - pre-prep -css - prep 让它做一些额外的编译
And then this babel-preset-css-prep allows
it to do some extra compiling ahead of

27
00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.506
是时候让它更快了
time to make it even faster.

28
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.293
>> 布莱恩: 好的，我要回去做 npm 的工作了
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
i'm going to back to doing npm run dev so

29
00:01:48.293 --> 00:01:50.444
我的服务器又启动了
that my server is started again.

30
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.859
然后我就把这个藏起来
And then I'm just going to hide this.

31
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.281
所以我想让你做个新文件
So I want you to make a new file.

32
00:01:54.281 --> 00:02:01.409
我希望您将其称为 NavBar.js，在您的源目录中，并保存该目录。
I want you to call it NavBar.js, inside
of your source directory, and save that.

33
00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.858
好了我们要从雷法进口
Okay, here we're going to
import React from React,

34
00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.719
>> Brian: 从 @reach/router 导入链接，
&gt;&gt; Brian: import Link from @reach/router,

35
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:22.492
就像在一个锚上一样
which is gonna be a link,
as in a anchor tag.

36
00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:30.284
我们将从 @emotion/core 导入 css 。
And we're going to import
css from @emotion/core.

37
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.920
>> Brian: 在这里，我们将说 const NavBar 等于一个函数。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Here we're going to say
const NavBar equals a function.

38
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.763
我们会在这里做一个隐含的回报。
And we'll do an implicit return here.

39
00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:49.415
然后说标题， >> Brian: And
And say header,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

40
00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:54.855
然后联系到这个就像一个 href，
then link to, this is just like an href,

41
00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:59.349
通过我，这将是徽标。
Adopt Me, this will be the logo.

42
00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.204
然后在那下面
And then underneath that,

43
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:07.795
我们将会有一个带有伊斯兰教标识标签的跨距
we're going to have a span
with an aria label of logo.

44
00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:11.020
然后我们要在这里放一个情绪激动的
And then we're going to
put an emoji in here.

45
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.021
然而你却选择在那里放上一个情绪
So however you choose to
put an emoji in there.

46
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.776
所以在 Mac上，您可以按下 Ctrl+Cmd+space 和
So in on Mac,
you can hit Ctrl+Cmd+space and

47
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:21.055
这将打开用于扇情的选择器。
this will open the selector for emojis.

48
00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:25.685
你可以为这个项目挑选你最喜欢的标志。
And you can pick your favorite logo for
the project.

49
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.137
我肯定会和一个蠢货一起去的
I'm definitely gonna go with a poodle.

50
00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:35.360
> > 布莱恩: 我也要给它一个角色。
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
I have to give it a role as well.

51
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.352
so role = img.
so role = img.

52
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:51.387
> > 布莱恩: 好的，然后在下面
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and
then down here at the bottom

53
00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:56.050
你会说出口默认的纳夫巴尔
you're gonna say export default NavBar.

54
00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.289
那么到目前为止还没有什么特别的东西吗
So nothing special here too far,
right, so far?

55
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.930
但我想用这个标题做一些很酷的事情。
But I want to do something
cool with this header.

56
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.687
我要说 " css="
Here, I'm gonna say css=.

57
00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:16.197
然后我就给它一个小 css
And then I'm gonna give it a css,
like that.

58
00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:17.994
然后我就把它放在这儿
And then I'm gonna put a back tick here.

59
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:26.072
>> Brian: 因此，请注意，这是 css ，然后直接后是后退。
&gt;&gt; Brian: So notice that this is css, and
then directly afterward is a back tick.

60
00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:29.538
现在我意识到这对我们大多数人来说都很奇怪因为我们大多数人
Now I recognize that this looks odd for
most of us, because most of us don't deal

61
00:04:29.538 --> 00:04:32.889
在每天的 JavaScript中使用标记的模板字面值。
with tagged template literals
on a day to day in JavaScript.

62
00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.167
这是 2015 年的一个特征，它是一个模板字符串，
This is a feature that came in in
2015 that it's a template string,

63
00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:41.398
就像你能在这里的模板一样对吧
as in like a template string like
one that you could have here, right?

64
00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:44.151
而且这也能起作用。
And this would work just as well.

65
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.764
就像这样对吧
Like that, right?

66
00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:50.202
> > 布莱恩: 但它是有标记的，所以
&gt;&gt; Brian: But it's tagged, so

67
00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:52.735
它将通过这个 CSS 函数运行它。
it's actually going to run it
through this CSS function.

68
00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:55.264
这就是所有标记的模板字面值
So that's all a tagged
template literal does for

69
00:04:55.264 --> 00:04:57.987
你是通过一个功能来运行这些东西的好吗
you is it runs this stuff
through a function, okay?

70
00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:00.704
现在我们可以用普通的 CSS 来写。
Now we can write in here
in just normal CSS.

71
00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:03.966
因此，背景色: #333。
So background-color: #333.

72
00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:09.036
现在你们很多人可能没好
Now many of you are probably
not getting good

73
00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:13.970
语法突出显示，对吧 ?
syntax highlighting right here, right?

74
00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:18.040
注意我也要自动完成任务
And notice that I'm also
getting autocompletion.

75
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.042
所以如果我说立场的话，我也会在这里做得很好。
So if I say position, I'm getting
good autocompletion here as well.

76
00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.230
所以我要告诉你们如何用代码来快速。
So I'm gonna show you how to do
that really quick with Code.

77
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.108
如果您单击此处的 " 扩展 " 部分。
If you click here on
the Extensions on the side.

78
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.920
搜索，以及
Search for, and

79
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.689
我意识到这有点反直觉，但也有一些成分。
I recognize this is a little
counterintuitive, but styled-components.

80
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.459
其实我已经装了
I actually have it already installed.

81
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.406
我来帮你找
So let me find it for you.

82
00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:40.649
它是 vscode - styled-components，在这里。
It's vscode-styled-components,
this one here.

83
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:45.028
>> Brian: 因此安装此文件和
&gt;&gt; Brian: So install this one and

84
00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:48.465
那么它就会神奇地解决你所有的问题
then it'll just magically
fix all of your problems.

85
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:55.018
> > 布莱恩: 好的，就按 vscosde-styled 搜索，
&gt;&gt; Brian: So yeah,
just search for vscode-styled,

86
00:05:55.018 --> 00:05:56.675
可能是第一次了
it probably will be the first one.

87
00:05:56.675 --> 00:06:01.045
在拍摄过程中，这有 47.5 万次下载，非常多。
So as of filming,
this has 475,000 downloads, so a lot.

88
00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:05.357
> > 布莱恩: 好吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?

89
00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:07.310
>> Brian: 因此，一旦您拥有此功能，就应该开始看到语法突出显示。
&gt;&gt; Brian: So once you have that, then you
should start seeing syntax highlighting.

90
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.646
您可能必须重新启动编辑器，但可能不是。
You might have to restart your editor,
but probably not.

91
00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:12.434
也许吧
But maybe.

92
00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:15.411
还有。
And.

93
00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:21.624
> > 布莱恩: 那是
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's.

94
00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:32.367
> > 布莱恩: 是的，我要给它 15 像素的填充物。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, so I'm gonna give
it padding of like 15 pixels.

95
00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:34.737
是的，让我们看看这看起来是什么样的。
And yeah, let's see what that looks like.

96
00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:42.374
> > 布莱恩: 所以我们得先把它放在首位，那是对的。
&gt;&gt; Brian: So we have to go put
it in first, that's right.

97
00:06:42.374 --> 00:06:46.504
所以我想让你去 app.js
So I want you to go into app.js.

98
00:06:46.504 --> 00:06:53.115
这里有标题，让我们把它替换为标题。
And here we have the header,
let's just replace this with Header.

99
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:58.521
>> Brian: 或 NavBar，我们称之为 NavBar。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Or NavBar,
that's what we called it, NavBar.

100
00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:03.524
> > 布莱恩: 我们也要进口。
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we'll have to import that as well.

101
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:13.795
>> Brian: 来自 ./NavBar。
&gt;&gt; Brian: From ./NavBar.

102
00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:18.290
我们不再使用链接，因此您也可以将其删除。
And we stopped using links, so
you can go ahead and delete that as well.

103
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.651
从达图 / 路由器那里开始。
Up there from reach/router.

104
00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:27.653
> > 布莱恩: 好吧，现在理论上
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now in theory.

105
00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:30.026
我想我们还有一件事要做
I think we have one more
thing to do here as well.

106
00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:30.646
我们有
We do.

107
00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:36.259
>> Brian: 所以我们安装了 Babel 预置。
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
we installed the Babel preset.

108
00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:44.718
所以我们最后需要做的事情是去照看婴儿，对不起，
So last thing we need to do here is
go into babble, sorry, .babelrc.

109
00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:48.007
而且我们也要用这个
And we have to use this one as well.

110
00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:48.555
所以
So

111
00:07:48.555 --> 00:07:58.170
@emotion/bel-预置-css-prop
@emotion/babel-preset-css-prop

112
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.918
就像这样
like that.

113
00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:02.476
所以你也要把这个也包括在内，
So you have to go include this as well,

114
00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:05.879
因为巴贝尔也要为我们做一些转变
because babel has to do some
transformations for us as well.

115
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.350
你把这个情感/巴贝放进去了，所以
You put in this emotion/babel, so

116
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.180
我们实际上需要向它添加一个配置。
we actually need to add
one configuration to it.

117
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.697
在另一个阵列中换行。
So wrap this in another array.

118
00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:17.036
在此处放置逗号，然后放置对象。
Put a comma here, and then an object.

119
00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:24.714
你必须说 sourceMap: 假的。
And you have to say sourceMap: false.

120
00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:33.635
>> 布莱恩: 这很烦人，因为你会失去做地图的能力。
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's annoying, because you're
gonna lose the ability to do source maps.

121
00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:38.495
但是现在，E运动 CSS 道具与一些
But for right now, Emotion CSS
prop doesn't play well with some

122
00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:43.179
还有其他的事情所以我们就得关闭地图
other things as well, so
we just have to turn off source maps.

123
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.552
在我看来，这并不是一个非常大的交易。
In my opinion,
it ends up not being a very big deal.

124
00:08:50.552 --> 00:08:54.349
所以现在我们有了这么美丽的艺术作品
So now we get this beautiful work of
art that I'm probably killing our

125
00:08:54.349 --> 00:08:55.269
设计师。
designer with.

126
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.463
但很漂亮我做了
But it's gorgeous and I made it.

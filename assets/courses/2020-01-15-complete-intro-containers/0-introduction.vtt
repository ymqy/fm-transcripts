1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.071
容器对我很刺激
Containers are really exciting to me.

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:06.277
我开始为 Azure，云提供商工作，作为工作的一部分，
I started working for Azure, the cloud
provider, and so as part of that job,

3
00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:09.029
我每天都在容器里工作
I work a lot on the day-to-day
with containers.

4
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:14.169
为了我的工作我必须深入了解容器的工作方式
And so for my job, I had to really dive
in and figure out how containers work,

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.489
如何为使用容器的开发者和工程师提供最佳服务。
how to best serve developers and
engineers using containers.

6
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.920
所以我想和你们分享其中的一些知识。
And so I wanted to share some
of that knowledge with you all.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.966
所以我们先去潜水吧
So let's go ahead and dive in.

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.059
我要点击引言
I'm gonna click on the Introduction.

9
00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.399
所以只需要做另一件家务
So just another kind
of housekeeping thing,

10
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.609
你会在这里看到的欢迎-引言
you'll see it here it says,
Welcome-Introduction.

11
00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.530
您可以在此处看到它对应于 " 欢迎 " 部分和
You can see here that it corresponds
to the Welcome section and

12
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.759
引入部分，冷却。
the introduction part, cool.

13
00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:44.090
所以我在这方面的目标是为了
So my course objective at this end of
this is to kinda demystify containers for

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.750
你让你觉得他们更容易接触
you and make you feel like
they're more accessible.

15
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.231
那是我的容器问题的一部分
So that was part of my
problem with containers,

16
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:49.723
我觉得他们是基础设施方面的东西。
I felt like they were
an infrastructure thing.

17
00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:54.054
我是个前端工程师或者现在就跟 JavaScript 工程师一起去
I'm a front end engineer or let's just go
with JavaScript engineer these days, and

18
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.531
所以我觉得集装箱是办公人员的事不是为了
so I felt containers were something for
the office people and not for

19
00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:58.520
工程师
the engineer.

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.619
所以我就从来没有接触过它
And so I just kind of never
approached it cuz I had that kind of

21
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.509
在我脑海里有一个概念
conception in my mind.

22
00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.361
所以我的目标是要崩溃
And so my course objective in this is
to kind of breakdown that barrier for

23
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.353
所有容器都可以访问任何正在进行任何排序的任何人
all of you so that containers are
accessible to anyone that's doing any sort

24
00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:09.263
工程的价值。
of engineering work.

25
00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:13.715
我认为这对所有人来说都是有用的
And I think that can be useful to everyone
from the deepest part of operations all

26
00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:15.450
和设计师的方式是吧
the way to designers, right?

27
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.338
我认为这些容器对整个这里的人来说都是有用的。
I think that the containers can be useful
to the entire spectrum of people here.

28
00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.439
我要告诉你这是从工程的角度来看的
So I'm gonna tell you that this is gonna
come from an engineering perspective,

29
00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.435
因为那是我的背景，是前期工程，最后是 Node.js
because that's my background, is front-end
engineering and then eventually Node.js

30
00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:30.599
后端工程和所有东西之间的一切
back-end engineering and
kind of everything in between.

31
00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:32.802
但我认为这对大家都是有用的。
But I think this can be
useful to everybody.

32
00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:36.593
如果你之前有过我的课程
And if you've followed
any of my courses before,

33
00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:38.373
你知道我喜欢破门的方法
you know the way that I
like to break things down.

34
00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:42.353
所以我喜欢直接下地去做什么工作
So I like to break go down directly
into what makes something work, and

35
00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.250
然后就从那里建立起来了
then kind of build up from there.

36
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.403
向您展示所有工具，以及它们所解决的问题。
And show you all the tools, and
what problems they solve are.

37
00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:47.826
这正是我们要做的
So that's exactly what we're gonna do,

38
00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.420
我们要先手工建造容器
we're gonna build
containers by hand first.

39
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.353
那你是谁 它针对的是一个开发者人口。
So who are you?
It's aimed at a developer demographic.

40
00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:58.623
这再次，不是说它不能被别人使用。
That is again, not to say that
it can't be used by anyone else.

41
00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:02.620
这个过程就像是有点 Linux 知识，对吧 ?
This course does assume like a little
bit of Linux knowledge, right?

42
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.540
因此我假定您知道如何更改目录和
So I assume that you know
how to change directory and

43
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.090
与命令链接的基本 Linux 交互类型。
the very kind of basic Linux sort
of interactions to command link.

44
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.728
所以如果这是你第一次跟指挥部互动的话
So if this is your first
interaction with the command line,

45
00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:17.262
你可能还能继续追踪但你可能无法得到这么多的信息
you'll probably still be able to follow
along but you may not get this much out of

46
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.935
你也会在学习指挥的过程中学习
it 'cuz you'll be learning
command line as you go as well.

47
00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:24.822
我建议把吉姆 - 扬的课带给满满的大师
I would suggest taking Jim Young's class
for the masters with the full stack

48
00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:29.550
他们刚放弃了它的 V2 太棒了
engineering which they just dropped
V2 of that, which is great.

49
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.849
吉姆是我的同事
Jim is my co-worker from Netflix.

50
00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.018
所以我爱他
So I love him.

51
00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:36.159
他深入地处理了各种交互的 bash 类型，
He goes over in depth with bash
types of interactions, and so

52
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.424
这对你来说是很有用的
that'll be very helpful
if that's new to you.

53
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.590
还有别的吗
What else?

54
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.061
你可以看到我有我的麦克，我会在麦克上做这个。
So you can see here I have my Mac,
I'll be doing this on the Mac.

55
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:51.280
我在 Windows 上测试了所有东西，实际上我在这里有一台 Windows 笔记本电脑。
I've tested everything on Windows, and
I actually have a Windows laptop here.

56
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.280
所以如果有人看这个现场有任何关于 Windows 的问题，
So if anyone watching this live has
any questions about Windows stuff,

57
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.331
请你随意问
please feel free to ask.

58
00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:58.843
然后，我们可以切换到 Windows 模式，然后一起解决这个问题。
And we can switch over to Windows mode and
figure this out together.

59
00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:02.193
如果你在麦克或者在 Linux上
If you're on Mac or if you're on Linux,

60
00:03:02.193 --> 00:03:05.846
一切都应该准备好了
everything should just
be fine ready to go.

61
00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:07.545
您只需安装 Docker。
All you need to do is install Docker.

62
00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:12.110
如果您在 Windows 10 上，那么可能需要执行一些额外的步骤。
If you're on Windows 10, there's a couple
extra steps that you might need to go to.

63
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.189
如果您有 Windows Professional ，并且它的关键是它的 Professional，而不是 Home。
If you have Windows Professional, and
it's key that it's Professional, not Home.

64
00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.949
专业的我建议你安装 WSL 2
Professional, I'll suggest
that you install WSL 2.

65
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.379
但你可以在这里看到我有一个链接可以做到这一点。
But you can see here I
have a link to do that.

66
00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.757
这代表了 Linux 的 Windows 子系统，它是它的第二个版本。
That stands for Windows subsystem for
Linux and it's the second version of it.

67
00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:31.759
它允许您在 Windows中直接运行 Linux 。
It allows you to run like Linux
directly inside of Windows.

68
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.270
有我最喜欢的 Windows 功能是很酷的。
It's really cool to have my
favorite features of Windows.

69
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.234
然后，会有一个 Docker 的预览发行版，
And then there is a preview
release of Docker that will

70
00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:42.438
从 Docker 或 WSL 连接到 WSL 。
connect you into WSL from Docker or
from WSL.

71
00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:47.879
如果您没有 Windows Professional ，或者您也不想设置 USL ，
If you do not have Windows Professional or
you don't wanna set up the USL too,

72
00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.983
如果我们诚实的话就有点烦人了
cuz it's kinda annoying to
set up if we're being honest,

73
00:03:51.983 --> 00:03:54.764
那么您需要下载 VirtualBox。
then you need to download VirtualBox.

74
00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:57.721
还有 VirtualBox ，而不是 Ubuntu VM。
And VirtualBox and instead of a Ubuntu VM.

75
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:01.699
我在这里设置了指示，所以如果你点击这个，
And I have set up instructions here,
so if you click on this,

76
00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.521
这就把你带到修理科的自述文件里
this will just take you to
the readme of the class repo, and

77
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:09.210
你可以在这里看到我对所有人都有一些指示
you can see here I have some
instructions for everyone.

78
00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.660
如果您有 Windows Home ，那么您可以在此处关注此博客帖子。
And if you have Windows Home,
then you can follow this blog post here.

79
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.175
这只是一个人写的文章
Which is just a article
that someone wrote.

80
00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:25.139
如果你想超越曲线，你就会有 Docker 在运行，
If you wanna get ahead of the curve and
you have Docker running, just go ahead and

81
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.769
把这些照片都拉上来
pull all of these images.

82
00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:29.589
这就给你省点时间了。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
This will just save you some time later
when we're getting to this point so

83
00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.329
您不必等待这些容器下载。
you don't have to wait for
these containers to download.

84
00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:34.653
你也可以的，也不着急。
You can also do at the time too,
there's no rush to as well.

85
00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.999
最后，如果你在 Windows 上，你很清楚 PowerShell ，
Lastly, if you're on Windows and
you know PowerShell very well,

86
00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:46.540
我认为这里的一切都可以像 PowerShell一样完成。
I think everything in here can be
done almost as is from PowerShell.

87
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.420
我不知道 PowerShell ，我知道我在微软工作。
I don't know PowerShell,
I know I work at Microsoft.

88
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.829
但是我不知道 PowerShell
But, yeah, I don't know PowerShell.

89
00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:57.680
但我至少知道 Docker 命令的工作方式是 PowerShell。
But I do know at least the Docker
commands work as is from PowerShell.

90
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.615
因为如果你对我有疑问的话，就会有自己的风险
So that one kind of do at your own risk
because if you have questions about it I

91
00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:03.750
无法回答。
cannot answer them.

92
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.870
好的那是指令
Okay, so that was set up instructions.

93
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.189
所以我们在班里有一堆迷你项目。
So we have a bunch of mini
projects in this class.

94
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.898
所以它是一群非常小的部分。
So it's a bunch of very small sections.

95
00:05:16.898 --> 00:05:22.031
所以，如果你不感兴趣的话，你可以跳过一些事情。
So for the most part you can skip over
something if it's not interesting to you.

96
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:27.216
然后在这里，如果你点击这里，这会带你去看 GitHub 存储库。
And then here, in this repo, if you click
here, this will take you to a GitHub repo.

97
00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:31.449
这里所有的解决方案都适用于各种不同的问题。
And here all of the solutions to all
of the various different problems.

98
00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.340
如果你愿意的话可以自由克隆人
So feel free to clone this if you like.

99
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.310
或者你可以点击这里来参考这个特定的项目，
Or you can just click in here and
reference this particular project,

100
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.235
对你也是一样的
that's kind of up to you as well.

101
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.204
好吧好吧
All right.

102
00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:52.209
对于您的计算机，我建议使用至少 8 GB 的 RAM。
For your computer, I would suggest
having at least 8 gigabytes of RAM.

103
00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:55.481
容器可以吃掉大量的资源，特别是在不小心的情况下。
Containers can eat up a lot of resources,
particularly for not careful about it.

104
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.480
我觉得这可能，这台电脑有 8 GB 所以
I think this would be possible,
this computer here has 8 GB so

105
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.257
我能保证一切都能顺利完成
I can guarantee that everything
works well with 8 gigs.

106
00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:04.324
我想你能得到 4 GB的
And I think you could get by with 4 GB.

107
00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:06.336
祝你好运
Good luck.

108
00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:11.394
最后一件事是如果你还在
[LAUGH] And the last thing is,
if you're on

109
00:06:11.394 --> 00:06:15.230
在带宽有限的情况下，这个过程会使用很多带宽。
something that is bandwidth limited, this
course is gonna use a lot of bandwidth.

110
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.310
我们只会拉和推图像之类的东西
Cuz we're just gonna be pulling and
pushing images and stuff like that.

111
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.146
所以只要知道如果你在带宽有限的情况下
So just be aware that if you have if
you're in a bandwidth limited situation,

112
00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:24.396
那将是一个令人关注的问题
that would be a concern.

113
00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:29.250
好吧怎么说呢
All right, where to file issues?

114
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.966
这是 GitHub上的所有开放式源代码存储库。
This is all an open source repo on GitHub.

115
00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:34.879
所以我就去找一个你可以去的链接
So I will drop to a link right
there that you can go and

116
00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.620
文件问题或打开的拉取请求。
file issues or open pull requests.

117
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.326
我非常鼓励它帮助保持这个过程的新鲜和有用
I very much encourage that it helps to
keep the course fresh and useful for

118
00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:42.004
每个人
everybody.

119
00:06:45.098 --> 00:06:45.641
那我是谁
So who am I?

120
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:49.340
我在巴黎喝了两杯啤酒
That's me in Paris like
two years drinking a beer.

121
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.139
那是一瓶非常大的啤酒非常好
It's a very large beer, was very good.

122
00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.226
谢谢 [ LAUGH]。
Thank you [LAUGH].

123
00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:54.603
我叫布莱恩
My name is Brian.

124
00:06:54.603 --> 00:06:58.153
我在 Microsoft Visual Studio Code上工作
I do work at Microsoft Visual Studio Code,

125
00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:02.430
而且我在 Azure上管理 JavaScript
as well as I manage
JavaScript across Azure.

126
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.975
所以我现在是一个节目经理，就是我读了很多邮件，
So I'm now a program manager, which is
just means that I read a lot of emails and

127
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.170
参加很多会议
attend a lot of meetings.

128
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.386
但在我职业生涯中的大部分时间里，我都是高级的 JavaScript 人员，是 Node . JS 工程师。
But for most of my career, I've been a
senior JavaScript staff, Node.JS engineer.

129
00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:17.815
我在 LinkedIn， Netflix， Reddit 和其他几个地方做过。
I've done that at LinkedIn, Netflix,
Reddit, and a couple other places as well.

130
00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:20.699
我也是 " 诗人 " 的董事会成员
I'm also on the board for Vets Who Code.

131
00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.639
我不是兽医但我很欣赏他们的工作
I'm not a vet, but I quite appreciate
the stuff that they do, so

132
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.951
我真的很喜欢那个慈善机构
I really like that charity.

133
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.040
所以我鼓励你也看看这个。
So I encourage you to take
a look at that as well.

134
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.831

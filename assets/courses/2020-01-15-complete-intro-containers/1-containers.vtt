1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.072
什么是容器?
What are containers?

2
00:00:02.072 --> 00:00:05.179
所以这可能比你们想象中的要简单得多。
So that's probably more simple
than some of you may think.

3
00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:07.269
你们中的一些人可能已经知道了这个问题的答案。
Some of you might already know this,
the answer to this question.

4
00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.419
但实际上没有这样的东西
But there's actually no such thing,

5
00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.385
一个是 Linux 容器的东西，对吧 ?
one single thing that is
a Linux container, right?

6
00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:16.940
我们想知道一个容器就是这个，我们说，好， Linux，
We like to have this idea that a container
is this, we say, all right, Linux,

7
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.940
集装箱就可以了对吧
containerify that and
it just works, right?

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.699
而且还没那么简单
And it's not quite that simple.

9
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.091
Linux 容器实际上是在
A Linux container really is
actually a combination of at

10
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.730
Linux 中至少有三个不同的内核功能。
least three different kernel
features within Linux.

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.663
这正是一个容器的理念。
That kind of culminate in this
idea of what a container is.

12
00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:37.945
再说这都是命令行的
And again, this is gonna be
all here in the command line.

13
00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.560
所以如果你有任何问题，请你去看看杰姆的课程。
So if you have any issues with it,
go ahead and check out Jem's course on it.

14
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.340
这是个不错的课程
It's a great course.

15
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.234
所以在我们开始进入一个容器之前
So, Before we kinda start getting
into what is a container,

16
00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.311
我要给大家一点历史，说明为什么我们需要容器，对吗 ?
I'm going to give you a little bit the
history of why we need containers, right?

17
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.994
带领你完成我们今天所经历的旅程
Kind of lead you through the journey
of how we got to where we are today.

18
00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:00.966
我希望你能想象一下
So I want you to picture for a moment that

19
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:06.670
你是一个大公司的工程团队的负责人对吧
you are head of a engineering
team at a big corporation, right?

20
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.126
您需要在某个地方托管您的 Web 站点。
And you need to host
your website somewhere.

21
00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:11.087
我不知道你怎么变成了一个没有网站的工程师
I don't know how you became a head of
engineering with no website already.

22
00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:17.228
但这就是我们为假设性而发现的情况，好吗 ?
But this is the situation that we find
ourselves in for this hypothetical, okay?

23
00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:21.368
所以如果你 15 年前，或者 20 年前，做这个，你应该开始
So if you had been 15 years ago, or
20 years ago, doing this, you should start

24
00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:24.870
想想，好吧，我要买一堆服务器。
thinking about, all right, well,
I need to buy a bunch of servers.

25
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.489
我得搞清楚我的数据中心要去哪了
And I need to figure out where
my data center's gonna go.

26
00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:31.283
我要雇佣一堆人来管理诈骗
And I need to hire a bunch of people
that are gonna manage racking and

27
00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:33.471
堆叠服务器之类的
stacking servers, stuff like that.

28
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.810
就像我在这里说的你和裸机服务器合作对吧
As I call it here,
you're working with the bare metal, right?

29
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.206
所以你要去戴尔公司你要去 EMC公司
So you're actually going to Dell,
you're going to EMC.

30
00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:43.575
你会去一些真正大的云提供商。
You're going to some of these
really big cloud providers.

31
00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:46.222
或者不是云提供商，而是硬件供应商和
Or not cloud providers,
but hardware providers and

32
00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:49.484
说我需要多少服务器我需要这些东西
saying I need x amount of servers and
I need these kind of things.

33
00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.799
然后，您必须担心物理安全性，数据中心。
And then you have to worry about
physical security, the data center.

34
00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.239
你得担心温度的问题
You have to worry about the temperature.

35
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.979
你必须担心升级那些已经不够强大的东西。
You have to worry about upgrading things
that that are no longer powerful enough.

36
00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.099
你得担心这类的事情
You have to worry about all
sorts of stuff like this.

37
00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.909
对我来说，就是想坐在这里，整天写我的 JavaScripts 的开发者，
For me, the developer that just wants to
sit here and write my JavaScripts all day,

38
00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.382
听起来很像我不想做的事对吧
that sounds like something I very
much do not wanna do, right?

39
00:02:10.382 --> 00:02:12.129
这里有交易对吧
There are trade-offs here, right?

40
00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.822
人们还是这样做的，对吧 ?
There are still reasons
that people do this, right?

41
00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:16.090
目前仍有许多公司在裸机服务器上运行。
There are still lots of
company running on bare metal.

42
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.865
我想你们很多公司还在裸机服务器上运行，对吧 ?
I imagine many of your companies are still
running on bare metal servers, right?

43
00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:20.639
更安全对吧
It's more secure, right?

44
00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.560
因为你没和任何人分享对吧
Because you are not sharing
anything with anyone, right?

45
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.159
你控制一切
You control everything.

46
00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.180
你控制着你的整个命运
You control your entire destiny.

47
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.367
如果你有这些规模经济的话，你可以便宜一些，
If you have these economies of scale,
it can be cheaper for you,

48
00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:32.920
对，而不是在公云上做什么。
right, than doing something
in the public cloud.

49
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.776
如果你有任何非常敏感的东西
And if you have anything that's
extremely performance sensitive,

50
00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:42.060
你可以调整你的盒子就像你需要的一样
you can tune your boxes to be as
whatever you need out of them.

51
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.629
但有很多问题，这很贵，对吧 ?
But it comes with a lot of problems,
this is expensive, right?

52
00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.555
你要买的能力要比你能用得多，对吧 ?
You have to buy more capacity
than you can use, right?

53
00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.019
如果你要打你的身份
Because if you're hitting your capacity,

54
00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.798
这意味着你要把东西放在地板上
that means that you're
dropping stuff on the floor,

55
00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:54.829
这意味着你总要有更多的能力
which means that you always have to
have more capacity than you're using.

56
00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.332
我们的应用有很多季节性的季节性，对吧 ?
And a lot of has seasonality to our apps,
right?

57
00:02:56.332 --> 00:03:00.507
所以如果你有足够的能力来处理 " 单身日 " 或 " 黑色星期五 " ，
So if you have enough capacity to handle
Singles Day or Black Friday, that means

58
00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:04.389
你有一堆服务在今年剩下的时间里无所事事对吧
you have a bunch of service just sitting
idle the rest of the year, right?

59
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.002
你得担心破事对吧
You have to worry about stuff breaking,
right?

60
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:11.550
有时候 RAM 变坏了吧
Sometimes RAM just goes bad, right?

61
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.721
然后你得把它修好
And then you have to go in and fix that.

62
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:14.789
这也是你现在的问题
That's also still your problem now.

63
00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:19.829
让我们说你需要更多的产能，对吧 ?
And let's say you need to
buy more capacity, right?

64
00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.228
不像你可以说，嘿，库伯内特，给我另一个节点，对吧 ?
It's not like where you can just say, hey,
Kubernetes, give me another node, right?

65
00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:24.819
而你只有一个
And you just have one.

66
00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.811
你得再打电话给戴尔说，我需要更多的服务器，对吧 ?
You have to call up Dell again and
say hey, I need more servers, right?

67
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.295
我想写一个 Kubernetes 的供应商
I actually thought about writing
a Kubernetes provisioner that made

68
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.804
购买请求，对吗 ?
a purchase request, right?

69
00:03:33.804 --> 00:03:35.930
然后当它回来并上线的时候
And then eventually when it comes back and
comes online,

70
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.680
那就把你的节点吐口水了吧
then it spins up your node, right?

71
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.395
这是最糟糕的想法
That's the worst idea.

72
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.789
这很贵，所以我还没写。
It would be terribly expensive and
that's why I have not written it.

73
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:41.948
我也没有足够的钱去做
I also don't have enough money to do that.

74
00:03:41.948 --> 00:03:46.949
所以，嗯，只需要一个或两个月的时间，对吧 ?
So, Yeah, that only takes a month or
two, right?

75
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:47.598
这很简单
It's pretty much instant.

76
00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:52.620
[ LAUGH] 希望你现在就知道了
[LAUGH] So
hopefully you're getting the point now.

77
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.573
裸机有它的存在对吧
Bare metal has its ups, right?

78
00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:56.189
但它有很多淡化的问题。
But it has a lot of downsides.

79
00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.799
这就是为什么很多公司不再做裸机服务的原因。
There's a reason why a lot of companies
don't do bare metal service anymore.

80
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.439
那么，让我们深入了解虚拟机。
So let's get down into
virtual machines then.

81
00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.830
所以如果我有一个网络服务器
So if I have a Web server,

82
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.415
我是在数据场上的一个服务器上运行的，对吧 ?
I'm running it on one server
blade within my data farm, right?

83
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:14.020
我在裸机操作系统上运行一切
I'm running everything on bare
metal operating systems like that.

84
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.382
其实很酷的是我能拥有一个服务器的农场
Well, what would be really cool is I could
actually just have a farm of server and

85
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.507
那我就会有任意数量的服务器在运行，对吧 ?
then I could have an arbitrary amount
of servers running on them, right?

86
00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:23.810
这就是虚拟机进入画面的地方，对吧 ?
And that's kind of where virtual
machines come into the picture, right?

87
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.608
所以我可以有一个服务器但是我可以有多个不同的操作系统
So I can have one server but I can have
multiple different operating systems

88
00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:30.396
与虚拟机同时运行，对吧 ?
running at the same time
as virtual machines, right?

89
00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:33.529
在这个意义上它们是虚拟服务器。
They're virtual servers, in that sense.

90
00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.762
这将会非常有帮助，因为现在我可以扩大规模，
And that gets to be very helpful
because now I can scale up and

91
00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:39.875
在我的数据中心容量范围内缩小，是吗 ?
scale down within my capacity
of my data center, right?

92
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:43.764
这很有帮助，因为我只需要管理能力。
And that that's helpful because then
I just have to manage capacity.

93
00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:45.860
如果我有一个小队下线了
Cuz if I have one team go offline,

94
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.980
他们就会把他们的服务拿回来
they take down their service,
I can then reclaim that immediately and

95
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.159
再给它加些东西，就从这个其他的这个队网上来的，对吧 ?
add more stuff to it, right from this
other team that's coming online, right?

96
00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.031
所以这种虚拟化策略允许我们分离 VM，对吗 ?
So this kind of virtualization strategy
allows us to separate VMs, right?

97
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.067
目前，我们还是要管理自己的硬件，还有
At this point, we're still having to
manage our own hardware and we still have

98
00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:06.180
来管理我们的操作系统和司机还有其他的东西
to manage our operating systems, and
drivers, and all that kinda stuff.

99
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.143
但是，至少我们可以在自己的能力范围内扩大规模和规模。
But, at least, we can scale up and
kinda scale down within our own capacity.

100
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.060
所以，让我们来谈谈为我们解决的其他问题。
So, let's talk about something
else that this solves for us.

101
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.074
假设我们现在正在运行一个托管供应商，对吧 ?
Let's say that now we're running
a hosting provider, right?

102
00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:21.552
某种类型的共享托管提供程序。
Some sort of shared hosting provider.

103
00:05:21.552 --> 00:05:23.781
假设我有两个不同的客户
Let's say I had two different clients and

104
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:27.531
我刚把他们都从 root 用户的电脑中删除了
I just dropped them both with
root access to the same computer.

105
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:30.377
他们只是说，好了，现在运行你们的服务器。
And they're just say, all right,
now run your servers.

106
00:05:30.377 --> 00:05:32.853
现在，如果你的皮肤开始爬行，那么好。
Now if you're skin is starting to crawl,
good.

107
00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:35.605
这意味着你已经了解到这些了，对吗 ?
It means that you already
understand some of this, right?

108
00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:38.845
但如果你的皮肤没有爬行，让我来为你爬行。
But if your skin's not crawling,
let me make it crawl for you.

109
00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:41.534
所以，让我们想象你有两种类型的提供程序。
So let's imagine that you
have two sort of providers.

110
00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:44.014
让我们说一个他们的名字是可口可乐，其中一个叫百事可乐，对吧 ?
Let's say one them's name is Coca-Cola and
one of them's name is Pepsi, right?

111
00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:51.365
可口可乐决定在他们的服务器上存储，对吧 ?
And Coca-Cola decides to store on
their server recipe.txt, right?

112
00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:52.701
现在，希望你能看到我在这里的情况。
Now, hopefully you can see
what I'm getting at here.

113
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:56.870
如果我们在同一台服务器上有百事可乐的话
If we have Pepsi on the same server,
they could just change directory over into

114
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.269
可口可乐的目录和秘方。
Coca-Cola's directory and
say secret recipe.

115
00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:01.499
我知道了太棒了
I got it, great.

116
00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.990
我不知道为什么在这种情况下我让百事可乐坏了
I don't know why I made Pepsi
the bad guy in this situation.

117
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.728
但他们肯定是坏人对吧
But they're definitely the bad guy, right?

118
00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:12.860
好吧这就不太棒了对吧
[LAUGH] All right, so
this ends up being not great, right?

119
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.334
这就是为什么虚拟化也能有所帮助，因为现在它们处于不同的环境中
So that's why virtualization can also
help too because now they're in different

120
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:17.250
操作系统。
operating systems.

121
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.639
他们甚至都看不到对方对吧
They can't even see each other, right?

122
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.329
他们甚至不知道他们在同一台服务器上。
They don't even know that
they're on the same server.

123
00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:23.766
对他们来说这些都是 Ubuntu 的副本
To them they just, all right,
here's a copy of Ubuntu.

124
00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:27.110
你就在 Ubuntu 上就这样了对吧
You're just chilling out on Ubuntu and
that's it, right?

125
00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.593
不过我们还是有问题的对吧
We still have problems here though, right?

126
00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:35.348
如果我运行一个托管供应商和可口可乐
If I if I'm running a hosting provider and
Coca-Cola and

127
00:06:35.348 --> 00:06:39.110
百事可乐在同一台电脑上的 VM 上
Pepsi are on VMs on the same computer,
well,

128
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.840
如果我是百事可乐我只能说在我的特定 VM内运行一个叉式炸弹
if I'm Pepsi I can just say run
a fork bomb within my particular VM.

129
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.050
这会消耗所有资源， CPU和内存，以及所有这些东西。
Which consumes all of the resources, and
CPU, and memory, and all that kinda stuff.

130
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.624
它会把服务器和
And it would take down the server and

131
00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:54.509
它会把所有人都放在服务器上对吧
it would take down everyone on the server,
right?

132
00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:00.279
这样，它们就会导致可口可乐的宕机，而这将是一个大问题。
So that way they could cause downtime for
Coca-Cola and that would be a big problem.

133
00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.733
比掉下叉子炸弹的人要少得多
And much less nefarious than
someone dropping a fork bomb,

134
00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:05.250
如果你还没有听到叉子炸弹的话我就把它丢在里面了
if you haven't heard of a fork
bomb I dropped a link in there.

135
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.738
这只是个简单的命令几乎能让整个系统
It's a little short command that just
takes down an entire system almost

136
00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:09.490
马上
immediately.

137
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.480
很有趣的
It's kinda fun.

138
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.190
别在自己的电脑上运行
Don't run it on your own computer.

139
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.988
但你不能就这么简单的
[LAUGH] But yeah, much less nefariously,
you cannot just have

140
00:07:16.988 --> 00:07:21.680
写了一个漏洞的人泄露了内存并把整个服务器都拿走了
someone that wrote a bug that leaked
memory and took down the entire server.

141
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.139
你想让他们自己冷静下来
And you want them to just
take themselves down.

142
00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.269
你不想让他们把所有人都带走对吧
You don't want them to take
down everybody, right?

143
00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.379
所以我们在这里仍然有一个问题
So that's kind of we still have
a problem here by just having

144
00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:30.230
和越南船民一样
the same people on VMs.

145
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.829
现在，使用虚拟机，如您可能猜测的，您还可以限制多少。
Now, with VMs, as you may guess,
you can also limit how much.

146
00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:41.069
好了，你只得到这么多的核，就能得到这么多的 RAM。
All right, you only get this many cores,
you only get this much RAM.

147
00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:42.279
你可以缓解其中的一些解决方案。
And you can kind of mitigate
some of those solutions.

148
00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:46.019
但我要给你们展示如何用 C 组的东西来做更多的事情。
But I'm gonna show you how to do that
even more with something called C groups.

149
00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:53.269
所以我们在这里还有一点性能问题。
So we still have a bit of
a performance problem here, as well.

150
00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:57.672
不是的，我说我十个服务器都在一个虚拟机内
It's not, let's say that I have ten
servers running as VMs all within one

151
00:07:57.672 --> 00:07:59.663
在我的数据中心中被跟踪的服务器。
racked server in my data center.

152
00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:03.324
但是我们这里还有一些开销让这个仍然是低效的
But we still have some overhead here
that's making this still an inefficient

153
00:08:03.324 --> 00:08:04.180
系统，对吧 ?
system, right?

154
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.338
如果有台服务器在运行 10 个不同的服务器，那么我们就必须运行 10 个副本，
We have to run ten copies of, if we have
a server that's running ten different,

155
00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:13.963
一个正在运行十个不同的 Web Service 的硅服务器，对吗 ?
a silicon server that's running
ten different Web services, right?

156
00:08:13.963 --> 00:08:16.730
我们还得运行十个操作系统的副本。
We still have to run ten
copies of an operating system.

157
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.300
我们在 10 份操作系统上浪费了这些容量。
And we're wasting some of that capacity
on ten copies of the operating system.

158
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.639
如果我们能在操作系统上运行一个副本是很棒的，对吧 ?
It would be great if we could just run
one copy to the operating system, right?

159
00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:29.009
这就是我在这里用容器暗示的东西。
So this is what I'm hinting
at with containers here.

160
00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:36.788
所以，如果你想直接和越南船民一起玩，杰姆就会这样做。
So again, if you want to play with
VMs directly, Jem's course does that.

161
00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:39.899
船民仍然是一个非常有效的选择。
And VMs are still very
much a very valid option.

162
00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:43.889
我知道很多人还在使用 Azure VM 和 AWS ， EC2，对吧 ?
I know a lot of people out there are still
using Azure VMs and AWS, EC2, right?

163
00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:46.038
非常，非常有效的事情还在用，
Very, very valid things still to be using,
and

164
00:08:46.038 --> 00:08:48.289
仍然存在您要使用 VM的原因。
there's still reasons
that you want to use VMs.

165
00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:49.990
所以你也应该和那些人一起玩
And so you should definitely
play around with those as well.

166
00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.860
就像我说的杰姆在 Fronmaster Master 的课程是给你的
And like I said, Jem's course on
Frontend Master does that for you.

167
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.186
所以我觉得他和 DigitalOcean一起出去玩
So I think he goes out and
plays out with DigitalOcean.

168
00:09:03.591 --> 00:09:08.269
好，这就给我们带来了公共云的情况，对吧 ?
Okay, so that brings us to the public
cloud kind of situation, right?

169
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:12.224
这会是微软 Azure 亚马逊网络服务公司
So this is gonna be Microsoft Azure,
Amazon Web Services,

170
00:09:12.224 --> 00:09:13.893
Google Cloud Platform。
Google Cloud Platform.

171
00:09:13.893 --> 00:09:18.392
你会经常听到我说 GCP 和 AWS 因为我在商界工作
Which you'll often hear me saying GCP and
AWS, because I work in the business and

172
00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.588
我不禁要用缩略语。
I cannot help myself but use acronyms.

173
00:09:20.588 --> 00:09:21.686
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.797
他们已经把我带走了
[LAUGH] they've taken me.

175
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.554
这太好了因为我已经移动了数据中心
So this is great because now
I've moved the data center

176
00:09:27.554 --> 00:09:30.480
离开我的特殊公司对吧
away from my particular company, right?

177
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.039
我不再需要这些管理员了
I no longer have to have these admins.

178
00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.613
我不需要买实物
I don't have to buy physical space.

179
00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:37.870
我不需要担心温度之类的事情
And I don't have to worry about
temperatures or anything like that.

180
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.490
我只是说嘿 Amazon Web Services 或 hey ， Microsoft Azure
I just say hey, Amazon Web Services,
or hey, Microsoft Azure,

181
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.114
给我另一个 VM 让我提供点东西
give me another VM and
let me provision something.

182
00:09:46.114 --> 00:09:49.701
这些公司在世界各地拥有巨大的数据中心
And those companies have massive
data centers all over the world,

183
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:52.789
每一个都有 30 到 40 个不同区域。
each one of them has like 30 or
40 different regions.

184
00:09:54.149 --> 00:09:57.095
这真的很棒。
So that's really great.

185
00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.533
我们在这里得到规模经济的经济
We get the economies of scale here and
I just pay them for

186
00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:03.037
我正在使用的 CPU 量的计量表，我使用的内存量。
the spinning the meter of how much
CPU I'm using, how much memory I'm using.

187
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:05.700
他们把所有服务都给我了
And they handle all those service for me.

188
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.019
他们负责更新硬件。
They handle updating the hardware.

189
00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:08.643
你再也不用担心硬件了
You never have to worry about
hardware basically ever again.

190
00:10:08.643 --> 00:10:10.629
如果你还在使用越南移居者
Now if you're still using VMs,

191
00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:14.490
你还得担心作业系统，对吧 ?
you still have to worry about
the operating system, right?

192
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.963
他们把服务器给你
They give you the server.

193
00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:19.251
但如果有很大的安全漏洞
But if there's a big
security vulnerability,

194
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.909
你得修补好吗
you have to patch it, right?

195
00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:23.086
你得进去说 Ubuntu
You have to go in there and say Ubuntu,

196
00:10:23.086 --> 00:10:25.952
升级到最新的 LTS 或类似的东西。
upgrade to the latest LTS or
something like that.

197
00:10:25.952 --> 00:10:28.629
我觉得 LTS 是长期服务的
LTS stands for long term service, I think?

198
00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:31.200
>> 支持。 >> 支持，感谢长期支持。
&gt;&gt; Support.
&gt;&gt; Support, thank you, long term support.

199
00:10:32.654 --> 00:10:37.100
是啊这就是他们长期坚持的版本
Yeah, and that just means that's a version
that they maintain for a very long time.

200
00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:40.894
所以，公共云，这很棒。
So public cloud, this is great.

201
00:10:40.894 --> 00:10:44.264
你最后支付的钱可能比你要的要多
You end up paying perhaps a bit more
than you would have if you're running it

202
00:10:44.264 --> 00:10:44.817
你自己
yourself.

203
00:10:44.817 --> 00:10:46.664
但这里的交易是你不再需要雇佣员工了
But the trade-off here is you
no longer have to hire people.

204
00:10:46.664 --> 00:10:49.429
而且人一般都很贵，对吧 ?
And people are usually very expensive,
right?

205
00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:51.677
要管理物理数据中心，对吗 ?
To manage physical data centers, right?

206
00:10:51.677 --> 00:10:52.940
所以这才是交易的一部分
So that's kinda the trade off.

207
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.500
通常，由于这个原因，在公共云上几乎总是一个好主意。
Usually, it's almost always a good idea to
be in the public cloud for that reason.

208
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.210
从人类的角度来看，这通常比较便宜。
It's usually cheaper from
the human perspective.

209
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.418
现在就得说一个前端的工程师可以自己管理
And it's getting to the point now that
a front end engineer can manage their own

210
00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:05.455
服务器对吧
servers, right?

211
00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:07.909
这在 15 年前是不可能的
Which would have never been
possible 15 years ago.

212
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.347
所以在这些类似的情境工具中，如 Terraform， Chef， Puppet， Salt，
So in these kinda situations tools
like Terraform, Chef, Puppet, Salt,

213
00:11:13.347 --> 00:11:15.279
我们今天不谈论的事情
things that we won't be
talking about today.

214
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:18.240
我不认识他们你也不想学我
Cuz I don't know them and
you don't wanna learn them from me.

215
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.517
这些功能将非常有用，因为这允许您旋转服务器，提供这些服务器。
These will be useful because this allows
you to spin up servers, provision them.

216
00:11:20.517 --> 00:11:24.610
当我说条款条款时，我的意思是安装正确的软件。
And when I say the term provision, what
I mean is install the correct software.

217
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.413
确保所有内容都是最新的，下载您的代码，
Make sure everything's up to date,
download your code,

218
00:11:27.413 --> 00:11:29.712
开始运行代码所有这些东西
start running the code,
all that kinda stuff.

219
00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:33.090
这就是这些工具对你非常有用的地方。
That's where these tools can
be super useful for you.

220
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.129
一定要检查他们是否有你想做的事
Definitely check them out if that's
something that you're interested in doing.

221
00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:40.269
但我们仍在支付在云中运行整个操作系统的成本。
But we're still paying the cost of running
a whole operating system in the cloud.

222
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:42.517
我们还得管理操作系统。
And we still have to manage
the operating system.

223
00:11:42.517 --> 00:11:46.700
如果我们能说我们的密码就好了
It would be nice if we could
just say here's our code.

224
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.480
这就是它需要的环境，执行这个，对吧 ?
Here's the environment it needs,
execute this, right?

225
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.240
这是一些种类的工件执行这一过程。
Here's this artifact of some variety,
execute this.

226
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.789
这就引出了容器的概念。
And that brings us to
the idea of containers.

227
00:11:59.789 --> 00:12:02.615
容器给我们提供了所有这些安全特性
Containers give us all of
these security features and

228
00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:05.960
所有这些虚拟机的资源管理功能。
all these resource management
features of virtual machines.

229
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.687
但它们重量轻得多是我最讨厌的术语
But they're much lighter weight,
which is a term that I hate but

230
00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:12.139
我还是会在这里用的因为这是一个毫无意义的术语，对吗 ?
I'm still gonna use here because it's
a absolutely meaningless term, right?

231
00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:14.929
什么是轻量级的，与什么相比 ?
What is lightweight and compared to what?

232
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:17.980
我觉得每个 JavaScript 框架都是轻质的，对吧 ?
I feel like every JavaScript framework
comes out is lightweight, right?

233
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.850
这才是最糟糕的
[LAUGH] It's the worst.

234
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.153
但我真的是认真的对吧
And but here I actually mean it, right?

235
00:12:23.153 --> 00:12:24.134
你可以说
You can say for

236
00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:29.610
请确保虚拟机的重量比运行裸机服务器的重量更轻。
sure that a virtual machine is lighter
weight than running bare metal servers.

237
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.302
而容器的重量比运行一个虚拟机更轻。
And the containers are lighter weight
than running a whole virtual machine.

238
00:12:34.302 --> 00:12:39.120
所以基本上我在做的就是冻结一个文件系统。
So basically what I'm doing is
I'm just freezing a file system.

239
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.088
我把它变成了一个容器图像。
I'm dumping that into a container image.

240
00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:44.350
然后我把它关掉，然后我就有了一些主机操作系统
And then I'm shifting that off, and then
I have some sort of host operating system

241
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.161
正在为我执行这些容器
that's executing these containers for me.

242
00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:53.658
所以你还会有多个东西在一个宿主容器里运行
So you're still gonna have multiple
things running in one host container

243
00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:54.508
系统，对吧 ?
system, right?

244
00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:59.006
我们对可口可乐百事可乐的问题也有同样的担忧
And we kinda have this same worry about
the Coca-Cola Pepsi problem that I'm

245
00:12:59.006 --> 00:13:02.188
就会在我旁边的
gonna be running this container and
then, next to me,

246
00:13:02.188 --> 00:13:04.628
另一个容器就要开始运作了
another container's gonna be running.

247
00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:07.264
我不知道是谁干的对吧
And I don't know whose it is or
what it's doing, right?

248
00:13:07.264 --> 00:13:09.352
所以我也有同样的关注
So I have these same, similar concerns but

249
00:13:09.352 --> 00:13:13.475
让我向您保证，由于容器的特点，无法相互了解。
let me assure you that with the features
of containers, they can't see each other.

250
00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:15.225
他们不能和对方互动
They can't interact with each other.

251
00:13:15.225 --> 00:13:17.279
他们甚至都不知道对方在那儿
They can't even know that
each other are there.

252
00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:20.809
很多非常聪明的人一直在研究这个问题。
And a lot of very smart people have been
working on this for a very long time.

253
00:13:20.809 --> 00:13:23.086
我很自信地说这很安全
And I feel pretty confident
in saying this is secure and

254
00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:24.830
你肯定该走这条路了
you should definitely go down this path.

255
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.501
以前也不是那样的
It didn't always used to be that way.

256
00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:27.549
现在是这样。
It is now that way.

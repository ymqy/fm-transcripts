1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.750
你肯定能用高山上的高山
You definitely can just go ahead and
use node alpine,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.919
它是 80 兆字节，对于你的生产项目来说，一切都是这样做的。
it's 80 megabytes which is nothing, for
your production projects, always do that.

3
00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.560
现在我们要做蠢事了，我们要去做自己的节点高山图像，因为我
Now we're gonna be dumb and we're gonna go
make our own node alpine image because I

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.359
想给你展示如何去做，如何设置这些不同的东西。
wanna show you how to do it,
how to set up all these different things.

5
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.309
所以我们要做的就是尝试和
So, what we're actually gonna try and
do is we're gonna try and

6
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.449
再把 80 兆字节进一步降低到 50 兆字节
get that 80 megabytes down even further so
you can get down to 50 megabytes.

7
00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.449
我们来吧
Let's do it.

8
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.266
太荒谬了
Let's be ridiculous.

9
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:34.636
所以我们还在这里的高山 - linux ，我们在 12 - 高山上。
So we're still in alpine-linux here,
we're in 12-alpine right here.

10
00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:38.508
我想让你做的不是说 12 号节点
And what I want you to do instead
of saying node 12-alpine,

11
00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:40.820
我要你说阿尔卑斯 3.10
I want you to say alpine:3.10.

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.118
所以如果我来这里说医生检查阿尔卑斯 3.10
So, if I come in here and
say docker inspect alpine:3.10,

13
00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:55.517
如果我把这个颜色给颜色就好了
this is way easier if
I just colorize that.

14
00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:04.114
你可以在这里看到，这可能是字节，所以
You can see here,
this is in bytes maybe, so,

15
00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:09.257
嗯，这个是五个点六兆字节。
yeah, this is five point
six-ish megabytes.

16
00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:12.060
挺小的吧
Pretty small, right?

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.206
这比我们从其他国家来的 80 个要小得多
That's significantly smaller than the 80
that we had coming from our other

18
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:20.480
来自节点 alpine 的应用程序，它仅包含一些更有节点的节点
application from node alpine, and it just
includes some more node nicety stuff

19
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.216
就像一些你可能想要的东西一样
like some good idea stuff that
you're probably gonna want on there.

20
00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:30.649
你只需要把这些东西包括在你最想要的东西上
Just include some of the stuff like that,
which for the most part you're gonna want.

21
00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.924
节点源人员和
The node source people and

22
00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:35.450
这种接近的形式是其他在这些事情上工作的公司。
the near form is the other company
that works on these kinda things.

23
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.780
好好保重，确保这些都尽量小。
Take pretty good care to make sure
that these are as small as possible.

24
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.840
所以相信他们是因为他们比你更可能在码头
So, trust them because they're probably
better at docker than maybe you are,

25
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.409
我不会这么说但他们肯定比我强
I'm not gonna say that, but
they're definitely better than I am.

26
00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.737
如果你出于任何原因听我的话
And if you're for
whatever reason listening to me,

27
00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:50.164
让我来代表他们的善意
so let me proxy that goodwill to them.

28
00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.618
或者你不喜欢我，我不知道，你也可以恨他们。
Or maybe you don't like me, I don't know,
then you can hate them too.

29
00:01:56.043 --> 00:02:01.106
所以我们要从这里的阿尔卑菠萝来
So, we're gonna do from alpine:3.10 here,
and what we're gonna

30
00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:06.004
我们要说的是 RUN apk 是包经理的名字
do is we're gonna say RUN apk which
is the name of the package manager,

31
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:10.360
不是安卓的东西如果你是从安卓来的
not Android stuff,
if you're coming from Android.

32
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.530
APK 是 Alpine Package Manager。
APK is the Alpine Package Manager.

33
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.841
添加，我要说 --更新我，仅表示先运行更新，然后再进行
Add, I'm gonna say --update me which just
means run updates first before you, make

34
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:25.650
请确保您正在获取这些版本的最新版本，然后获取节点并获取 npm。
sure you're getting the latest versions
of these, and get nodejs and get npm.

35
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.259
现在我们可以把这个和版本联系起来
Now we could tie this to versions, for

36
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.331
现在我要告诉你怎么这么做
now I'm just gonna show
you how to do it this way.

37
00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:39.235
现在我觉得我们要这么做才是最需要做的
Cool and for now I think that's actually
all we need to do to get all this running,

38
00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:41.528
我觉得我们没必要再做其他事了
I don't think we need to do anything else.

39
00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:46.575
让我们再试一次
And let's try this again.

40
00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:48.014
我们得建个建筑
We have to run a build.

41
00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.141
所以它能很快地做到这一点。
So it's actually able to do this
pretty quickly it looks like.

42
00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:11.764
再一次，如果我们仔细看看，这应该已经足够了。
And again, this probably should be
enough that if we took a look at it.

43
00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:15.293
我们来做我的 " 节点 " 应用程序。
Let's just do my-node-app.

44
00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:21.299
就在那儿
Right there.

45
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.627
我们大概有 85人了
We're up to about 85.

46
00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:25.390
我想这听起来是对的
I guess that sounds about right.

47
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.283
实际上，让我们重新启动整个 Docker 文件。
So let's actually just restart
this entire Docker file.

48
00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:31.675
好吧好吧
All right.

49
00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:35.192
所以我们只加 FROM alpine 3.10
So we just add the FROM alpine:3.10,

50
00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:39.401
RUN apk，节点 npm ，我们将再次运行此程序。
RUN apk, node npm and
we're gonna run this again.

51
00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:46.844
现在，如果我们检查，看看这到底是什么，所以这就结束了，
And now, if we inspect, take a look at
what this is, so this ends up being,

52
00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:49.168
就会有五十兆字节
there you go, about 50 megabytes.

53
00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:53.241
只为了让阿尔卑斯和 NodeJs 和 NPM 都在同一个盒子里
Just to get Alpine and NodeJs and
NPM, all on the same box.

54
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.364
现在，在缺省情况下， Alpine 不必安装节点用户。
Now, Alpine by default, doesn't
necessarily have the node user installed.

55
00:04:01.364 --> 00:04:06.665
这就是节点分发给我们的
That was something that the node
distribution is doing for us,

56
00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:12.780
所以我们得为自己做所以我们要做的是 RUN addgroup-S
so we have to do that for ourselves,
so we're gonna do RUN addgroup-S.

57
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.021
这也是我自己永远无法记住的事情。
Again, this is something I
could never remember by myself.

58
00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:18.440
我总是需要 Google，如何将用户添加到 LINUX。
I always have to Google,
how do I add user to LINUX.

59
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.052
我不知道我从来都不记得
I don't know,
it's just never something I can remember.

60
00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:26.146
这样我们就能复制他们的最佳做法
So we're gonna just copy their best
practices and we're gonna add a user

61
00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:31.254
称为节点，我们将添加用户 -S 节点，并在组节点中添加。
called node and we're going to add
user -S node, and in the group node.

62
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.367
现在，这增加了一个用户叫做节点。
So now, this has added a user called node.

63
00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:41.322
这里我们可以说 USER 节点。
And here we can say USER node.

64
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.581
这是我们可以说的建筑。
And here we can say build.

65
00:04:59.247 --> 00:04:59.922
我错过了吗
Did I miss one?

66
00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:01.690
阿杜瑟对不起
Adduser, sorry.

67
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.500
阿德瑟在那儿
Adduser right there.

68
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.456
这是未找到的添加。
This was saying add not found.

69
00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:09.893
太好了
It's adduser.

70
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.040
好了现在再试一次
All right, now try it again.

71
00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:14.045
好了好了
There we go.

72
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:19.028
现在，如果我说，节点应用就在那里，
Now if I say, node app right there, and

73
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:24.012
我说 whoamI ，应该说节点，凉爽。
I say whoamI, should say node, cool.

74
00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:28.264
>> Brian，您在哪里指定要获取的节点版本 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian, where did you specify what
version of node do you wanna get?

75
00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:32.572
> 所以，我没有，你会用 apk 来做。
&gt;&gt; So, I didn't,
here you would do it with apk.

76
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:37.603
现在我们不用担心这件事你会
Just for now we're not gonna worry about
it cuz this is something that you would

77
00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:38.192
从来没做过
never really do.

78
00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:41.459
但我们可以看到它的版本。
But we can see what version it is.

79
00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.473
所以我们可以说节点-- 版本。
So we can say node-- version.

80
00:05:44.473 --> 00:05:47.021
但愿是 12个，不， 10个。
Hopefully it's 12, no, it's 10.

81
00:05:51.112 --> 00:05:54.156
我觉得这里有一些命名法
And I think there is some nomenclature for

82
00:05:54.156 --> 00:05:59.029
啊，这个，你比如说十点十六，什么的。
this, you would say like,
at 10.16 or something like that.

83
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.470
我并不确定。
I am not actually sure.

84
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.992
但它会在那里
But it would be in there.

85
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:04.838
这也是阿尔卑斯的情况，所以我根本不认识阿尔派恩。
Again this is from Alpine, so
I don't know Alpine at all.

86
00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:19.266
所以现在是你想回去的地方
So, Now is wherever you wanna go back and

87
00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:25.230
加上之前我们的所有东西都是 USER 节点
add all of our stuff back that we
had before which is USER node,

88
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.471
RUN mkdir /home/node/ 代码。
RUN mkdir /home/node/code.

89
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:36.550
然后，您要执行 WORKDIR /home/node/code，
Then you wanna do WORKDIR /home/node/code,

90
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.086
COPY chown 节点节点包。
COPY chown node node pack.

91
00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:45.627
我是说你可以从我们过去的最后一个
I mean, you can literally copy this
from the last one that we used to have,

92
00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:47.981
包 lock.json package.json 。
package lock.json package.json.

93
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:50.625
我要把它复制到 ./.
I'm gonna copy that to ./.

94
00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:54.459
那我们就去拉联合国的保监处
Then we're going to RUN npm CI.

95
00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:57.100
如你所见，空格完全是任意的。
As you can see here,
whitespace is totally arbitrary.

96
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.947
我没有理由去做我现在正在做的事
And I have no good reason for
any of it that I'm doing right now.

97
00:06:59.947 --> 00:07:05.574
我说的是 COPY --chown node:node 和.
And I'm saying COPY --chown node:node,
and.

98
00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:09.786
将其他所有内容复制到同一目录中。
to copy everything else
into the same directory.

99
00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:15.214
我要说的是 CMD 节点 index.js。
I'm going to say CMD node index.js.

100
00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:20.584
所以，让我们回去再建这个。
So, let's go back and build this again.

101
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:23.663
我们来做吧
And let's run it.

102
00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:30.045
那么链接。
So the link.

103
00:07:32.648 --> 00:07:34.406
我们走了还在跑
There we go, still running but

104
00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:38.338
有一个阿尔卑斯的集装箱我们将继续建造自己
with a Alpine container that we're
continuing to build ourselves.

105
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:43.223
这么说和做了，看看我们是否真正拯救了自己的空间，
So all said and done, to see if we
actually saved yourself any space,

106
00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:44.706
我不确定我们是否做到了
I'm not actually sure we did.

107
00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:50.898
Docker 检查 my-node-app。
Docker inspect my-node-app.

108
00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:55.774
管道到 jq 可以获得一些颜色，因为这容易阅读。
Pipe to jq to get some colors
because it's a lot easier to read.

109
00:07:57.786 --> 00:07:58.490
好了好了
There you go.

110
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.612
所以我们下降到大约 56 兆字节。
So we got down to about 56 megabytes-ish.

111
00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:03.218
我们可以更低了
We can go lower.

112
00:08:03.218 --> 00:08:03.718
[ 笑声]
[LAUGH]

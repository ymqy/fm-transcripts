1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.350
你做的
You made it.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.870
你在接受真实采访时就像在精神上精疲力尽
You are as mentally exhausted as you
would be during a real interview,

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.950
除了采访者的判断少
except with less judgement
from the interviewer.

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.619
开玩笑的我一直都在暗恋你
Just kidding, I've been secretly
judging you all this entire time.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.984
好了现在怎么办
All right, so what now?

6
00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:19.312
结果。
The results.

7
00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:20.239
这些东西都是二进制的
These things are binary.

8
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.469
要么你过去要么你没通过
Either you pass, or you didn't pass.

9
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.870
奇怪的是你可能会失败
Odds are, you're probably gonna fail.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.949
我还是这样说，即便是在这个之后，做了很多很多的采访之后，
I still say this, even after this, even
after doing many, many interviews, and

11
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.609
给了很多很多的面试，我还是说面试是半运气的。
giving many, many interviews,
I still say interviews are half luck.

12
00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.460
我的确是这么想的
I do, that's just the way it is.

13
00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:43.597
有时你会在正确的一天得到正确的问题
Sometimes you're just gonna get the right
question on the right day with the right

14
00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:46.526
记者，你就在你的槽里，感觉，我知道。
Interviewer, and you're just in your
groove, feel like, I know this.

15
00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:48.920
我知道如何执行睡眠功能，因为我以前想过这个。
I know how to implement a sleep function
because I've thought about this before.

16
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.444
我知道如何执行扣骨
I know how to implement debounce.

17
00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.119
你会得到的
And you'll just have it.

18
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.640
你在你的槽里你知道的感觉很好
You're in your groove and
you know it, and it feels so good.

19
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.990
有时候不是你的一天
Sometimes, it's just not your day.

20
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.360
他们问你关于我们没有掩护的问题
They ask you every
question we didn't cover,

21
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.990
每个你都不可能知道的问题
every question that you
couldn't possibly know.

22
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.359
或者只是个不好的问题，要不你就在上面冻结。
Or it's just a bad question, or
you get up there and you freeze.

23
00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:08.379
没事的你不是失败就是这样
It's okay, you're not a failure,
that happens.

24
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:09.608
我接受了很多采访
I have failed many interviews,

25
00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:11.891
我的采访可能比我过去的要多了
I've probably failed more
interviews than I've passed.

26
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.349
我已经尽力去了 500 但很困难
I've tried to get to 500 but
yeah, it's tough.

27
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.248
没事的，你是个工程师，这很容易的打击。
It's all right, you're no less of
an engineer, and it's a hard ego blow.

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.635
但它会发生在精神上为自己做准备
But it's gonna happen,
just mentally prepare yourself for it.

29
00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:25.198
如果你过去了
And if you pass, hey,

30
00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:29.640
也许我会做一个关于如何谈判你的提议的短期课程
maybe I'll do a short course on
how to negotiate your offer.

31
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.480
这才是最有趣的阶段
That's always the fun phase.

32
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.259
如果你能把你的薪水提高 50 万
When you can increase your
salary by like 50 grand,

33
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.840
如果你很擅长谈判也许还有一些股票期权
maybe more if you're good at negotiating,
maybe some stock options.

34
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.439
也许有个愉快的假期
Maybe some nice vacation time.

35
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.229
那是美好的时光
That's the good times.

36
00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.608
这就是你想做的
That's what you wanna get to.

37
00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:43.849
你想要那个积极的压力
You want that positive stress.

38
00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.997
如果我能再挤出一万块呢
Like, what if I could squeeze them for
ten grand more?

39
00:01:45.997 --> 00:01:47.390
那是个好时光
That's a good time.

40
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.799
如果你失败了没关系
If you failed, that's okay.

41
00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.500
您可以尝试做的是要求反馈。
What you can try to do is ask for
feedback.

42
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.849
很多公司都是有反馈的 cagey ，我觉得是诉讼，
A lot of companies are cagey with
feedback, I think it's a lawsuit thing,

43
00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.950
他们不想被起诉什么的
they don't want to get sued or
something like that.

44
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.370
但是希望，如果公司的好处，他们会给你一些反馈。
But hopefully, if the company's good,
they'll give you some feedback.

45
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.751
他们会说你知道吗
They'll say, hey, you know what?

46
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.674
您 aced CSS，您 aced HTML。
You aced CSS, you aced HTML.

47
00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.817
您的一些数据结构虽然有点微弱。
Some of your data structure's
though a little weak.

48
00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:09.590
我会回来研究这些的
I would come back and study those.

49
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.526
这是很好的反馈。
That's good feedback.

50
00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:13.469
记住那里有胜利还有学习
Remember, there's winning and
then there's learning.

51
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.090
现在，如果你是记者，你说，嘿，我真的很喜欢这个人。
Now, if you're the interviewer and
you say, hey, I really like this person.

52
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.920
他们太棒了
They were fantastic.

53
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.810
他们不具备我们所期待的知识的深度。
They didn't quite have the depth of
knowledge that we're looking for.

54
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.680
这也会发生
That's gonna happen, too.

55
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.710
不是你面试的人都要经过
Not everybody you interview is gonna pass.

56
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.118
这就是它的发展方式。
That's just the way it goes.

57
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.969
所以作为采访者，我真的鼓励你给出反馈。
So as the interviewer,
I really encourage you to give feedback.

58
00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:34.789
我肯定会鼓励你的
I definitely encourage you.

59
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.469
如果你采访我的团队，你有电话屏幕，我总是写，
If you interview for my team, and you
have the phone screen, I always write up,

60
00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.889
需要一段时间，但是我总是写，哎，
it takes a bit of time, but
I always write up, hey,

61
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.579
这才是这个人做的事的好处
here's the pros of what this person did.

62
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.520
这就是他们没有成功的地方
Here's where they didn't succeed as much,
but

63
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.810
欢迎他们回来再再试一次
they're welcome to come back and
try again.

64
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.879
这很有用如果我说不就好了
And that's helpful,
cuz if I just say no, no what?

65
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.009
我没做对吧
What didn't I do right?

66
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.819
这对任何人都没有帮助
That's not helpful to anybody.

67
00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.930
如果你真的喜欢他们请他们重新申请
If you really like them,
invite them to reapply.

68
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.579
给他们反馈
Give them feedback.

69
00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.759
说哎，你回来工作，我不知道，你的 CSS 有点，我觉得你会
Say hey, if you come back and work on, I
don't know, your CSS a bit, I think you'd

70
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.909
在这个位置上是个王牌，但是我们需要你在那里展示一点更深的深度。
be an ace for this position, but we need
you to show a little bit more depth there.

71
00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.979
我认识一个人他们对 Netflix 应用了三次
I know someone,
they applied to Netflix three times.

72
00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.099
失败两次，第三次完成。
Failed two times,
got through the third time.

73
00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.006
第三次是他们学来的
Third time, they aced it.

74
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:18.990
我想和那些奉献的人一起工作
That's the kinda people I wanna work with,
people that are dedicated.

75
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.650
就像我说的你一定会失败的
And like I said,
you're probably gonna fail at some point.

76
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.039
没事的没事的
It's okay.

77
00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.550
如果你有一个好的经验，一个积极的经验，
If you gave a good experience,
a positive experience, and

78
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.710
你帮他们的时候你帮了他们他们没被人困在任何地方
you were helpful on the way, you helped
them, they didn't get stuck anywhere.

79
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.400
如果他们被困住了你真的帮了他们
If they did get stuck,
you really helped them out.

80
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.270
您邀请他们重新申请。
You invite them to reapply.

81
00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.569
工程，特别是前期工程，是一个非常小的世界。
Engineering, especially front engineering,
is a really small world.

82
00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.900
我可以扔些名字你可能都在推特上跟他们说
I can throw out some names and
you probably all follow them on Twitter or

83
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.150
因为我们都知道这件事
something like that,
because we all know the same thing.

84
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670
这是个小宇宙
It's a small universe.

85
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.546
所以别对采访你的人做傻事
So don't be a jerk to people
who are interviewing with you.

86
00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:50.539
你可能会再见到他们他们会记得你的
You will probably see them again and
they'll remember you.

87
00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:51.439
保持联络
And stay in touch.

88
00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.310
如果你真的喜欢别人
If you really like someone and

89
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.300
你觉得他们有很大的潜力和他们保持联系
you feel like they have a lot of
potential, stay in touch with them.

90
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.509
每 6 个月说几个话，你要重新申请吗 ?
Reach out every six months to say hey,
you want to reapply?

91
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.479
最糟糕的是你被拒绝了
The worst thing that happens
is you get rejected.

92
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.240
没有成本。
There's no cost.

93
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.939
除了你的自我还没有代价
Other than your ego,
there's no cost to that.

94
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.569
好吧好吧 这就是采访资金的问题。
All right.
So that was interviewing for finance.

95
00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.025
大家都做得很好你们都做了
Great job everyone, you all made it.

96
00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:12.879
我们都有点累了
We're all a little tired.

97
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.753
我是个小人有我的绿茶
I'm a little wired, had my green tea.

98
00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.329
感觉很好
Feeling good.

99
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.019
但你已经在这一天结束了
But you made it through
the end of the day.

100
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.399
现在我不能保证这些问题
Now, again I can't guarantee
that all these questions

101
00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:26.990
你会看到完美的例子你会看到类似的复制品
you'll see perfectly examples,
you'll see like exact replicas.

102
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.737
但你可能也会看到类似的问题。
But you'll probably see some
similar problems along the way.

103
00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:33.098
如果你遵循如何分解这个问题，它真的很有帮助。
And it really helps if you follow along
how to break down that problem and

104
00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:35.401
试着了解他们想做什么
try to understand what
are they trying to get at.

105
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.803
我想了解这个人的理解
I'm trying to understand this
person understands promises or

106
00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:40.879
他们懂得如何迭代 DOM之类的事情
they understand like how to
iterate the DOM, things like that.

107
00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.439
别把重点放在正确的答案上
And don't focus so
much on getting the right answer,

108
00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.230
说说你是怎么解决这个问题的
talk about how you got to the solution.

109
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.754
这可能是我给你的最有用的建议
That's probably the most
helpful advice I can give you.

110
00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.284
谢谢。
Thank you.

111

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.137
关于成功和失败的说明。
A note on success and failure.

2
00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.549
美国职棒大联盟
Major League Baseball.

3
00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.292
那些付出了数百万美元的人花了整整一百万美元
People that get paid millions and millions
of dollars to spend literally their entire

4
00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:14.179
做一件事，一般是用球棒打个球。
lives training to do one thing, and
it's generally to hit a ball with a bat.

5
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.082
那是不熟悉的美式棒球
That's American baseball for
those not familiar.

6
00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:23.699
此值为 0.300 ，这是一个好的平均批处理数。
This 0.300,
this is considered a good batting average.

7
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.468
这实际上被认为是一个极佳的击球平均。
This actually considered
an excellent batting average.

8
00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:28.925
这意味着每当你站在球棒上的时候
This means that every time that you
step up to bat, swing that ball,

9
00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.030
你有三个尝试，或者四，五个，这不重要。
you have three tries, or
four or five, it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.524
每次你去打就会有七次你会错过的
Every time you go up to hit,
seven out of ten times you're gonna miss.

11
00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.155
所以大部分时间你都会失败的
So you're gonna fail most of the time.

12
00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:42.460
但如果你成功地完成了这十次
But if you succeed three
out of those ten times,

13
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.426
你被认为是个非常好的保姆
you're considered a very good hitter.

14
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:45.960
你被认为是优秀的
You're considered excellent.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.990
很棒的球员，你可能获得了数百万美元的报酬。
Excellent player, you're probably getting
paid millions and millions of dollars.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.689
所以我想做的是重新思考失败的想法
So what I wanna do is reframe
thinking about failure,

17
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:57.965
因为那里有胜利还有学习
because there's winning and
then there's learning.

18
00:00:57.965 --> 00:00:59.639
Cuz ，您始终可以从失败中学习。
Cuz you can always learn
from your failures.

19
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.861
我想做的就是把我们弄到 0 .
Really what I wanna do is get us at 0.500.

20
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:09.676
这意味着每两次访谈中就有一个你会成功的
That means about one out of every two
interviews, you're gonna succeed,

21
00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:11.219
太神奇了
which is amazing.

22
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.031
听起来像是失败
It sounds like failure.

23
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.096
在你被拒绝和拒绝的时候
And at the time's where you're
getting rejected and rejected,

24
00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.207
你在想面试很困难我是个失败人
you're thinking,
interviewing's hard, I'm a failure.

25
00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:19.015
我不是一个好工程师
I'm not a good engineer.

26
00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:19.829
也许我不够聪明
Maybe I'm not smart enough.

27
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.518
但如果我能把你搞到一半
But if I can get you to half,

28
00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:27.260
就像你在面试中的一半一样你做得太棒了
as in you pass half your interviews,
you are doing phenomenal.

29
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.567
我和很多人谈过，没有人这样做。
And I talked to a lot of people,
nobody's at this.

30
00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.162
我不认识一个能每两次面试一次的人
I don't know a single person that can
pass one out every two interviews.

31
00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:35.057
聪明的人也是
Smart people, too.

32
00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:35.805
你听说过的人
People that you've heard of.

33
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:36.776
那些有图书馆的人
People that have written libraries.

34
00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:38.872
人们改变了我们对 JavaScript的看法
People that have changed the way
we think about JavaScript,

35
00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:41.200
他们无法通过两次访谈中的一个
they couldn't pass one
out of two interviews.

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.736
我想让我们作为一个社区，作为一个文化。
I'd like to get us there,
as a community, as a culture.

37
00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.890
我想让你到 0 .
And I wanna get you to 0.501.

38
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.234
所以我想让你略好一点
So I wanna get you slightly better
than half, cuz that's pretty good.

39
00:01:52.472 --> 00:01:54.406
今天我们要完成采访的步骤
Today we're gonna go through
the steps of an interview.

40
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.252
我们要从申请开始
We're gonna start with the application.

41
00:01:56.252 --> 00:02:00.147
我们会和招聘人员或招聘经理进行初步通话。
We're gonna go into that initial call
with the recruiter or the hiring manager.

42
00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:02.423
我们要去做密码测试
We're gonna go into the code tests.

43
00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:03.968
然后我们要谈电话屏幕
And then we're gonna talk
about the phone screen.

44
00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:06.489
然后我们就去现场吃点肉
Then we're gonna get to the onsite,
kind of the meat and

45
00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.485
如果你愿意去面试
potatoes, if you will, of interviewing.

46
00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:11.033
然后我们要谈谈结果如何交易成功
And then we're gonna talk about
the results, how to deal success,

47
00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:12.026
如何处理失败的问题。
how to deal with failure.

48
00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:15.492
如果你是说杰姆我们为什么不能直接跳到现场
And if you're saying Jem, why can we just
skip straight to the on-site part cuz

49
00:02:15.492 --> 00:02:17.063
我在乎的那部分吗
that's the part that I care about?

50
00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:19.569
我有个坏消息要给你
I got some bad news for you.

51
00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.289
从统计角度来说，大多数人永远不会到达现场。
Statistically speaking,
most of you will never get to the on-site.

52
00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:24.733
这只是个数字游戏
That's just a numbers game.

53
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.402
我想说很多大公司
I would say a lot of the big companies,

54
00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:31.508
他们大概会雇佣 10% 的人申请
they probably hire maybe 10%
of the people that apply.

55
00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:35.188
比这些大公司更容易进入斯坦福或哈佛
It's easier to get into Stanford or
Harvard than some of these big companies,

56
00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.602
就会有更多的人来
just by running the numbers.

57
00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:40.819
所以我想谈谈到现场的步骤。
So I wanna talk about the steps
to get to the on-site.

58
00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.213
然后我们会处理很多你可能得到的问题
And then we're gonna cover a lot of
the questions that you might get, or

59
00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:47.860
你要问的问题的风格
the style of questions you're gonna get.

60
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.491

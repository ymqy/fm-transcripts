&gt；&gt；steve kinney：猜猜现在轮到谁了，它是你的。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Guess who's
turn it is now, it's yours.

2
00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:09.680
因此我们知道NoteView，&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：NoteView是
So we know the NoteView,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: NoteView is

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.150
使用这个降价组件。
using this Markdown component.

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.696
我们知道Markdown组件现在占用了28千字节。
We know that the Markdown component
right now is taking up 28 kilobytes.

5
00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:22.125
我有一些关于角色实体的消息要告诉你，他们在一起[笑]对吗？
I've got some news for you about character
entities, they're together [LAUGH] right?

6
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:27.269
这是另一个25，所以这是另一个最初的10%，对吗？
Which is another 25, so
that's another initial 10%, right?

7
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.550
或者目前是我们最终捆绑包的20%
Or it's currently at this point
20% of our resulting bundle

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.299
我们现在不需要的东西。
that we don't need immediately.

9
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.518
所以如果我们能使用同样的技术那就太好了，
So it would be great if we
could use the same technique,

10
00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.360
创建可加载的NoteView。
create a loadable NoteView.

11
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.094
然后转到NoteView容器并将NoteView替换为可加载的NoteView。
Then go to the NoteView container and swap
out NoteView for the loadable NoteView.

12
00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.070
然后我们一起回来，我们可以重新分析它。
And then we'll come back together and
we'll be able to reanalyze it.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.692
我要在这上面做一个分支叫做实时编码。
I'm gonna make a branch on
this called live coding.

14
00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:52.909
我要把我现在拥有的东西推出来，这样你就可以把它拉下来了。
I'm gonna push out what I have
right now so you can pull it down.

15
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.990
如果你不喜欢纱线安装或MPM安装，你可以有那些依赖。
If you didn't like yarn install or mpm
install, you can have those dependencies.

16
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.654
你可以带着它转一圈，看看它会怎么样，然后
You can take it for a spin and
see how it goes, and

17
00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:02.460
那我们大约20分钟后一起做
then we'll do it together
in about 20 minutes.

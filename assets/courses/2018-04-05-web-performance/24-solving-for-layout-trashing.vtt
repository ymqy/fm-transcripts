1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.109
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：好的，我们来看看另一个例子。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, we're
gonna take a look at another example.

2
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:08.039
我要进去，关闭活动监控器。
Gonna go into that,
close activity monitor.

3
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.849
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：我只是要做一个MPM开始。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm just
gonna do an MPM start.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
我得到了服务器作为这个很酷的端口名称。
I got the server as this cool port name.

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.070
我们会继续我们会带它去兜风。
We'll go ahead we'll take it for a spin.

6
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.280
我们将使用布局乐趣。
We're going to use layout fun.

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.329
因为这就是我们现在谈论的。
Because that's what we're
talking about right now.

8
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.600
好的，这是一个动画。
All right so here's an animation.

9
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.939
你可以看到它相当简陋。
And you can see it's pretty janky.

10
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.030
对，那不是流畅的动画。
Right, that's not a fluid animation.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.390
事情有点结巴。
Things are kind of stuttering.

12
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:51.189
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：让我们来看看我们的工具。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go ahead and
take a look at our tools.

13
00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:52.079
我们来录音吧。
Let's do a recording.

14
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.665
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：你知道，
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And you know,

15
00:00:56.665 --> 00:01:00.569
这是更加简陋的，因为记录的过程需要大量的带宽。
this is even more janky cuz the process
of recording takes a lot of bandwidth.

16
00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.058
就像我之前说的，测量的行为会让事情变得更糟。
Like I said before,
the act of measuring makes stuff worse.

17
00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.040
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：尤其是如果你使用的是一台12英寸的小MacBook。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Especially if you're
on a little twelve-inch MacBook.

18
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.460
哇，那不是很好，对吧？
Wow, that's not great, right?

19
00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.063
太久了。如果我们走得足够远，
It's taking too long.
If we go in far enough,

20
00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:24.579
你可以看到它是，我们是我们在打击，对吗？
you can see that it is,
we are we're thrashing, right?

21
00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.370
我们正在重新计算。我们正在重新计算。
We're recalculating.
We're recalculating.

22
00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.650
这不太好对吧？
This is not good, right?

23
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.108
给定帧花费205毫秒。
A given frame took 205 milliseconds.

24
00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:36.390
用户会注意到的，对吧？
Users are gonna notice that, right?

25
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.549
这将是看起来和感觉为我们janky。
That is going to look and
feel janky for us.

26
00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.299
就算你们都在一堆箱子周围飞来飞去，就像完全一样。
Granted you're all flying around
a bunch of boxes, like totally.

27
00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.770
酷，所以最大的问题是我们该怎么做，对吧？
Cool, so the big question is
what do we do about it, right?

28
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.170
所以让我们来看一下代码。
So let's take a look at the code.

29
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.390
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：进入渲染。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go into rendering.

30
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.096
我们前进到移动的箱子，我们会看看。
We go ahead to the moving boxes and
we’ll look at.

31
00:02:03.096 --> 00:02:05.670
所以，我有一些我们不需要真正担心的设置代码。
So, I’ve got some setup code that we
don’t have to really worry about.

32
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.750
基本上就是让按钮工作，启动和停止。
It’s basically getting the buttons
working and starting and stopping.

33
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.330
并且，让我们假设它不存在。
And, let’s make believe
that doesn’t exist.

34
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.185
但是，如果你好奇的话，这里就是。
But, here it is in case you were curious.

35
00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:18.252
所以，我们有的是，我们将得到数组中的所有元素。
So, then what we have is we're gonna
get all the elements in array.

36
00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:20.256
然后，你猜对了，我们要读。
And then, you guessed it,
we're going to read.

37
00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:24.413
我们要做一些花哨的数学运算，让它成为动画，所以
We're going to do some fancy pants
math to just make it animatable and so

38
00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.364
它通过使用你知道的重现。
that it recurs by using you know.

39
00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:30.728
然后我们要改变他们的CSS转换，对吗？
And then we're going to change
their CSS transformation, right?

40
00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:37.969
正如我们所看到的，这肯定会给我们带来一些问题，对吧？
And as we saw, that is definitely
causing some problems for us, right?

41
00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.461
所以很明显，我们可以应用我们上次做的同样的事情，也就是做它
So obviously we could just apply the same
thing we did last time which is do it

42
00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:43.829
分两步，对吧？
in two steps, right?

43
00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:44.575
那会有用的。
That would work.

44
00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:46.680
让我们试一试，看看有什么不同。
Let's try it out see
what the difference is.

45
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.569
酷，所以让我们继续找出每个人的下一个位置。
Cool, so let's go ahead and
figure out each one's next position.

46
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.599
我觉得我的间距有点偏。
I think my spacing's a little off here.

47
00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.590
我们会为每个人找出下一个位置。
We'll figure out the next position for
each one.

48
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.955
所以我们说Const NextPositions复数。
So we'll say const nextPositions plural.

49
00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:11.509
我们将采用与上次完全相同的方法。
We'll do exactly the same
approach that we took last time.

50
00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.639
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：我们会继续，我们会在这里解决所有的问题。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go ahead and
we'll figure that all out here.

51
00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.590
一点点复制-粘贴动作。
A little bit of copy-paste action.

52
00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.789
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：这里我们只有const next Position。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
here we'll just have const nextPosition.

53
00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:46.729
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：好的，所以我们会继续做大量的阅读，
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so
we'll go ahead and do a lot of reading,

54
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.983
然后我们会继续做大量的写作。
then we'll go ahead and
do a lot of writing.

55
00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:51.088
让我们看看会发生什么。
And let's see what happens for us.

56
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:02.132
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：酷，所以让我们继续，好多了，对吗？
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so
let's go ahead, much better, right?

57
00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:03.155
光滑多了。
Much smoother.

58
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.370
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：让我们继续做另一个录音。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go ahead and
do another recording.

59
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.000
还有，你看到我在前一个中对CPU做了什么吗？
Also, do you see what I did to
the CPU in that previous one?

60
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.550
它对我不满意。
It was not happy with me.

61
00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.278
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：让我们在这里继续。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go ahead in here.

62
00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:27.204
你看，它看起来有点简陋，
You see it looked a little bit jankier,

63
00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.225
但是，&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：我们确实需要重新计算
but,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We do need to recalculate

64
00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:32.668
每一帧的风格，我们不会摆脱它，但是
the style for every frame,
we're not getting out of that one, but

65
00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:33.899
我们从200人下降到47人。
we went from 200 down to 47.

66
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:37.725
另一块冰在屏幕上没有你正在制作动画的那么多方框
The other piece of ice don't have that
many boxes on the screen you're animating

67
00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:38.579
同时。
at the same time.

68
00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.952
在这种情况下我们永远都不会进入16号，对吧？
We're never gonna get down to
the 16 in this case, right?

69
00:04:41.952 --> 00:04:45.720
但我们确实削减了80%，这将算作一场胜利。
But we did cut it by 80%
which will count as a win.

70
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.629
当你看到它不是所有的小盒子，对吗？
And when you see it's not all
of those little boxes, right?

71
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.941
好的，这就是我们所期待的。
Okay, that's what we expected.

72
00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:51.560
我们在前面的示例中看到了它。
We saw it in the previous example.

73
00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.939
这很酷，但有一个问题。
That's pretty cool but there's a problem.

74
00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.250
如果我告诉你不要这么做，你就会说，是的，我不会这么做的。
If I told you not to do this you'd just
be like, yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

75
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.211
还记得我之前在我的应用程序中向您展示的代码吗？
Remember that code I showed you
before in my application, right?

76
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:05.430
发生了。
It's happening.

77
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.639
不是我干的，我更清楚，对吧？
I didn't do it, I know better, right?

78
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.709
但这显然正在发生。
But it's clearly happening.

79
00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.704
因为如果我们把工作做好了，
Because if we're doing our jobs well,

80
00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:15.699
很多时候我们喜欢为不同的关注点分离代码，对吗？
a lot of times we like separating our
code out for different concerns, right?

81
00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.406
我们正在努力确保，好吧，这里重要的东西
We're trying to make sure that,
okay, the stuff that matters here

82
00:05:19.406 --> 00:05:22.740
与具有不同关注点的代码分离。
is separated from the code
that has a different concern.

83
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.581
这意味着你可以有一些布局颠覆发生在两个非常
Which means that you could have some
layout thrashing happening from two very

84
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:28.305
代码库的不同末端。
different ends of your code base.

85
00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:31.490
在那里你看不到一个发生在另一个之前。
Where you don't see one
happening before the other.

86
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.909
但事实证明，他们是，你穿插你的阅读和
But it turns out that they are,
you are interspersing your reading and

87
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:34.740
你的写作，对吧？
your writing, right?

88
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.790
你甚至不知道，因为它们在两个完全不同的文件中。
You didn't even know it because they're
in two totally different files.

89
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.173
你已经很久没碰过他们了，而且
You haven't touched one
of them in forever, and

90
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.927
很明显发生了，对吧？
it's clearly happening, right?

91
00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:43.819
这就是我如何在我的代码库中使用它。
That's how I had it in my code base.

92
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.235
当我第一次去找例子的时候，
When I first went to go find the example,

93
00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:50.230
我的计划是在项目中执行Cmd+Shift+F，在项目中查找。
my plan was to do a Cmd+Shift +F
in the project, find in project.

94
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.391
搜索一些我知道会有问题的布局属性。
Search for some of the layout properties
that I knew were gonna be problematic.

95
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:58.459
然后责备某人并取笑他们，对吗？
And then give blame to somebody and
make fun of them, right?

96
00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.639
代码中没有您可以看到发生这种情况的示例，对吗？
There was no examples in the code where
you could see that happening, right?

97
00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:02.829
一个接一个但是
One after the other but

98
00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.221
很明显，这是因为这些东西只是被分离出来的。
clearly it is because this stuff
was just separated out and out.

99
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:09.379
好吧，那你能做什么，对吧？
All right, so then what can you do, right?

100
00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:10.199
我们可以尝试一些事情。
We can try some things.

101
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.290
一种是使用requestAnimationFrame。
One would be to use requestAnimationFrame.

102
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.908
RequestAnimationFrame基本上告诉浏览器，嘿，当你准备
RequestAnimationFrame basically tells the
browser, hey, when you're getting ready to

103
00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:19.560
再次渲染，让我给你这个函数。
render something again,
let me give you this function.

104
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.019
你可以继续打电话给它，对吧？
And you can go ahead and call it, right?

105
00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:24.310
但根据定义，那是以后的事，对吧？
But by definition, that is later, right?

106
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.209
所以我们能做的就是我们现在可以在阅读的基础上做到这一点
And so what we can do is we can
do it off our reading now and

107
00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:29.161
然后我们总是可以只是我们可以嘿，
then we can always just we can be hey,

108
00:06:29.161 --> 00:06:33.069
无论何时写入DOM，我都会使用requestAnimationFrame so
whenever am going to write to the DOM I'll
use a requestAnimationFrame so

109
00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.370
我知道在运行我所有的代码时，我所有的JaveScript都会读取。
that I know that on this pass of running
all my code all my JaveScripts gonna read.

110
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.149
我知道稍后当所有这些请求AnimationFrames
And I know later when all
those requestAnimationFrames

111
00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.699
回到栖息地，所有的文字都将成批处理。
come back to roost all
the writing will be batched.

112
00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.577
我的意思是我们可以试一试，让我们看看。
I mean we can give it a shot, let's see.

113
00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:49.319
因此，这将涉及到有效地撤消我们之前所做的更改。
So this will involve effectively
undoing the change we did before.

114
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.795
你可以按Cmd+Z几次？
How many times can you hit Cmd+Z?

115
00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:58.980
好了，现在，我们开始吧。
All right, now, there we go.

116
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.529
酷，所以让我们抓住这部分，我们真正写的地方。
Cool, so let's grab this part
where we actually did the writing.

117
00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:03.620
我们只说requestAnimationFrame。
And we'll just say requestAnimationFrame.

118
00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:13.160
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：我们会把它放在那里。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we'll put it in there.

119
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.730
好的，现在我们知道这不会马上发生。
All right, so now we know it's
not gonna happen immediately.

120
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.701
这意味着所有的读操作都会发生，然后所有的写操作都会发生。
Which means all the reads will happen and
then all the writes will happen.

121
00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:25.959
我们会刷新页面，我还不能录音吗？
And we'll refresh the page,
I'm not gonna do recording yet?

122
00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.129
看起来很顺利，对吧？
Seems pretty smooth, right?

123
00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:31.190
看起来不错我很喜欢。
Seems good I'm into it.

124
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.319
好的，我们来录音。
All right, let's do a recording.

125
00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:43.800
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：我可能应该停止这样做。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I should
probably stop that.

126
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.019
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：所以我们在这里得到了这个更大的火焰图表。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we got this bigger flame chart right here.

127
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.151
部分原因是匿名功能
And part of it is that's
the Anonymous function

128
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:55.129
来自requestAnimationFrame，对吗？
from the requestAnimationFrame, right?

129
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:58.009
这是框架，使用匿名功能。
Here's the frame, use Anonymous function.

130
00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:02.521
然后我们会去觅食，但看看这个，我们正在计算很多
Then we are gonna forage but
look at that, we are calculating a lot of

131
00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:07.050
requestAnimationFrames因为我们做了一大堆，对吗？
requestAnimationFrames cuz we
are doing it a whole bunch, right?

132
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.689
我们只使用requestAnimationFrame，以使它在以后发生。
We are only using requestAnimationFrame,
to make it happen this thing happen later.

133
00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:14.855
我们不需要这么多动画帧，对吧？
We didn't need these many
animation frames, right?

134
00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:19.692
它实际上是在阻止我们制作动画帧。
It's actually stopping us
from animation framing.

135
00:08:19.692 --> 00:08:24.411
[笑]它阻止我们及时制作动画帧，对吗？
[LAUGH] It's stopping us from making that
frame in time for the animation, right?

136
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.610
比以前的版本好多了，对吧？
It's less bad than the previous version,
right?

137
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.549
这取决于你是乐观主义者还是悲观主义者。
Twice as better of half as bad depending
on if you are an optimist or pessimist.

138
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:37.529
但这肯定不好，因为我们正在做很多重复的工作。
But it's certainly not good because
we are doing a lot of repeated work.

139
00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:39.210
这并不是很好。
And that's not great.

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.020
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：问题是，你能堆叠多个
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Question is,
can you stack multiple

2
00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:05.580
报头中的缓存控制策略？
cache control strategies in the header?

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.320
我的直觉说不。
My gut says no.

4
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.509
我也意识到我从未尝试过。
I also realize that I
have never attempted to.

5
00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.605
所以我不能提供一个真正好的答案，但是
So I can't provide a really good answer,
but

6
00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.542
我最初的直觉是我不认为你可以。
my initial gut says I don't think you can.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.899
&gt；&gt；扬声器2：有人测试它。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone test it.

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.431
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：有人测试它，继续记录。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Someone test it,
keep recording.

9
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:35.049
[笑]&gt；&gt；steve kinney：还有其他问题吗？
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Any other questions?

10
00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.619
是啊。
Yeah.

11
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:37.030
&GT；&GT；演讲者3：也许你不知道从你的头上，但是
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Maybe you don't know
off the top of your head, but

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.689
只是好奇，关于发送网格或以前的项目。
just curious, on either send grid or
a previous project.

13
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:47.149
你有没有最喜欢的表演成就或者
Do you have a favorite sort of
performance accomplishment or

14
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.829
你脑海中浮现的任务？
task you've made that comes to mind?

15
00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.609
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：我认为最重要的一个，
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think one
of the most important ones,

16
00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.880
因为它先于所有其他指标，首先是获得指标。
cuz it precedes all other ones,
is getting the metrics in the first place.

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.869
比如弄清楚世界的状况并能让你知道这一点，
Like figuring out the state of the world
and being able to you know this,

18
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.069
找出这些行动，什么是重要的行动和
figuring out these actions,
what are important action and

19
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.349
算出他们需要多长时间，然后开始设置这些。
figuring out how long they take and
starting to set those.

20
00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.620
要么是性能预算，对吧，如果你不想让它变得更糟，或者
Either performance budget, right,
if you don't want it to get worse, or

21
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.760
绩效目标。
performance goals.

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.409
这是一项非同小可的任务。
That's a nontrivial task.

23
00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.430
试图获得这些测量，打开[INAUDIBLE]和
Trying to get those measurements,
cracking open the [INAUDIBLE] and

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.590
得到所有这些数字。
getting all those numbers.

25
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.170
这是第一步
It's the first step.

26
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.174
它通常是大多数应用程序中不存在的东西。
It's usually stuff that doesn't
exist in most applications.

27
00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:25.185
耐心，对吧？
Patience, right?

28
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.295
就像没人做过一样，所以这不是一件事，对吧？
Like nobody's done it,
thereby it's not a thing, right?

29
00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.655
在我的电脑上感觉很好，[笑]对吧？
Feels fine on my computer, [LAUGH] right?

30
00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.224
是最大的事情。
Is the biggest thing.

31
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:35.045
所以喜欢继续前进，使用喜欢的用户计时API来获得一些原始的
So like going ahead and using like
the user timing API to like get some raw

32
00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:39.125
数字，我觉得真的是那种喜欢的第一种。
numbers, I think is really
like the kind of like first.

33
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.104
因为在那之后你可以在它周围买东西，对吗？
Cuz after that you can get
the buy in around it, right?

34
00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:46.305
就像，Chrome现在有一些有趣的功能，工作方式不同。
And like, Chrome has some interesting
features now, that work different.

35
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:51.229
就像他们在我的应用程序上工作得不太好，因为我们必须登录，
Like they don't work super well on
my app because we have to log in,

36
00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.069
诸如此类的东西，但它们实际上向你展示了你的应用程序与你的竞争对手。
stuff like that but they actually show
you your app versus your competitors.

37
00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.569
这通常有助于买进。
That's usually helpful for getting buy in.

38
00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.500
这是一个相对较新的问题。
That's a relatively new one.

39
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.269
在Chrome中还有一个特别的，
There's another one in
Chrome specifically,

40
00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:05.340
将向您展示代码覆盖率，对吗？
will show you code coverage, right?

41
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.500
这意味着它会加载你的所有代码，你点击你的应用程序，然后
Which means it'll load up all your code,
you click around your app, and

42
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580
它会向您显示从未执行的代码行，对吗？
it'll show you lines of code
that were never executed, right?

43
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.879
所以就像开始得到这些指标，开始像这样，
And so like starting to get those metrics,
starting to get like these,

44
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.860
如果我有喜欢，让我们让应用程序走得更快！
if I have like,
let's make the app go faster!

45
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.900
感觉很棒，每个人都喜欢耶！
It's like great, everyone's like yeah!

46
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.889
然后什么都没发生对吧？
And then nothing happens, right?

47
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.939
因为就像没有一样，这是第一件要做的事，对吧？
Cuz like there's no like,
here's the first thing to do, right?

48
00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.969
所以我认为这是最重要的部分，对吧？
So I think that's the kind of
most important part, right?

49
00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.180
因为一旦你想把它建立到每个人都喜欢的文化中
Cuz like, once you kind of like build that
into the culture that everyone kind of

50
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.729
关心，完成所有这些事情变得容易多了。
cares about, it becomes a lot
easier to get all this stuff done.

51
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.050
在你建立它之前几乎是不可能做到的。
And it's almost impossible
to do before you build that.

52
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.170
所以这可能不是你要找的答案。
So it's kind of maybe not
the answer you're looking for.

53
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.112
但如果你问我最自豪的是什么，比如开始实施
But if you're asking what's the one I'm
proudest of, like starting to implement

54
00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:44.508
这些指标和某种程度上让绩效文化就位。
those metrics and kind of getting
the culture of performance in place.

55
00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:45.813
&gt；&gt；演讲者2：谢谢，太好了。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you, that's great.

56
00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:50.594
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：还有别的吗？
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Anything else?

57
00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:52.918
太棒了，非常感谢大家。
Cool, thank you so much, everyone.

58
00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:59.538

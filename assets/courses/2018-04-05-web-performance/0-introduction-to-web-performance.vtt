00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：您好，我们将讨论Web性能。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hello,
we're gonna talk about web performance.

2
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:09.009
[咳嗽]第一件事是第一件事。
[COUGH] First thing's first.

3
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:15.647
我的名字是Steve，我是SendGrid的首席前端工程师。
My name is Steve, and I am a principal
frontend engineer at SendGrid.

4
00:00:15.647 --> 00:00:17.853
我们在SendGrid做了很多事情
We do a bunch of things at SendGrid,

5
00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:21.769
主要业务是每天发送10亿封电子邮件。
the main business is sending
out a billion emails a day.

6
00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.710
因此，如果你曾经使用Uber并获得电子邮件收据，我们会将其发送给你。
So if you've ever taken an Uber and gotten
an email receipt, we sent that to you.

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.877
或者在eBay上失去了竞标，我们通知了您这一不幸的损失。
Or lost a bid on eBay,
we informed you of that unfortunate loss.

8
00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:34.804
Spotify潘多拉
Spotify, Pandora,

9
00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:38.340
所有这些类型的电子邮件基本上都是通过SendGrid进入您的收件箱。
all of those kind of emails basically go
through SendGrid to get to your inboxes.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.526
简单的思考方式是类似Twillio的东西，但对于电子邮件来说。
Easy way to think about it is
something like Twillio but for email.

11
00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:45.055
我不做这方面的工作，
I don't work on that part,

12
00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:50.810
我在一个富客户端应用程序上工作，用于构建电子邮件。
I work on a rich client side
application for building emails.

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.082
这真的很棒，你可以获得在Reaction in中工作的所有优势
Which is really great, you get all the
advantages of getting to work in React in

14
00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:59.051
然后构建应该在Ala2007中呈现的电子邮件。
the modern web and then build emails
that should render in ala 2007.

15
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:03.971
这很有趣，只是一个有趣的琐事事实是Outlook，你就像，
Which is a lot of fun, just a fun trivia
fact is that Outlook, you're like,

16
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.170
是的，可能使用的是Internet Explorer的渲染引擎。
yeah that probably uses
Internet Explorer's rendering engine.

17
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.070
不，它使用Microsoft Word。
No no, it uses Microsoft Word.

18
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.852
如果你感兴趣的话，我们可以稍后再谈。
So that's something we can talk
about later if you're interested.

19
00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:18.718
但是是的，关于一个大客户的事情，
But yeah, and
the thing about a large client set up,

20
00:01:18.718 --> 00:01:23.650
因为这实际上是我们正在构建的浏览器的桌面应用程序，对吧。
cuz this is effectively a desktop app
that we're building the browser, right.

21
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.670
你会遇到一些有趣的问题。
And you come across some
interesting problems.

22
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.760
几个月前我做了一个关于管理州的研讨会，
I did a workshop a few months
ago on managing state,

23
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.170
您如何管理此应用程序中发生的所有事情？
how do you manage all the things that
are happening in this application?

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.378
另一个问题，也是今天的主题，
The other question, and
kind of the theme of today,

25
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:43.159
就是你如何以一种真正保持表演的方式来做这件事
is how do you do it in a way that
actually stays performant for

26
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.962
用户既使用3，000美元的MacBook，也使用较旧的PC？
users both on a $3,000 MacBook
as well as an older PC?

27
00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:52.740
您如何让它为距离数据中心一步之遥的人工作
How do you have it working for people who
are a stone's throw from the data center

28
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.960
它在芝加哥和世界各地都举办过，对吗？
that it's hosted from in Chicago as
well as across the world, right?

29
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.132
以及应用程序如何保持性能，因为它是活着的
And also how does the application
stay performant as it's alive for

30
00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:02.530
很长一段时间？
a long period of time?

31
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.700
所以我们将查看性能并找出如何
So we're gonna look at performance and
figure out how

32
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.469
我们是否考虑过性能，以及我们将要做出的取舍是什么？
do we think about performance and what are
the trade offs that we are going to make?

33
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:15.139
有一些完全做这件事和表现将是伟大的，对吧。
There are some totally do this thing and
performance is gonna be great, right.

34
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.496
但很多时候你必须做个交易或者
But a lot of times you have
to make a trade off or

35
00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:19.986
你必须放弃一些东西才能得到一些东西。
you have to give up
something to get something.

36
00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:23.401
根据您正在构建的应用程序类型，
And depending on the kind of
application that you're building,

37
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:25.780
这些权衡的答案是不同的。
the answer to those
trade offs is different.

38
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.060
所以我们会讨论一下理论，权衡，
So we'll kind of talk a little bit
about the theory, the trade offs,

39
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.310
引擎盖下的东西是如何工作的。
how stuff works under the hood.

40
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.879
因为很多性能建议你只需在互联网上阅读
Because a lot of the performance advise
that you'll just read on the Internet

41
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.289
很可能已经过时了。
could very well be outdated.

42
00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.349
如果你只是遵循所有这些事情，只是要求你必须做的事情
And if you just kinda follow all those
things, just mandates that you have to do

43
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.509
在您的应用程序中，很可能他们要么没有帮助，要么
in your application, it's likely
that they're either not helping, or

44
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.469
更糟糕的是，会损害应用程序的性能。
worse, hurting the performance
of your application.

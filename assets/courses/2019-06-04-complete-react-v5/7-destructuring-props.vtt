00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.145
>> Brian Holt: 现在，我将向您展示如何使此电子邮件变得轻松一点。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, I'm gonna show you how
to make this email a little bit easier.

2
00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:06.950
所以当你写 " React " 时，写道具点很快就会变得非常老了，
So writing props dot gets very old very
quickly when you're writing React, so

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.169
有一件事你可以称之为破坏
there's a thing that you can
do called destructuring.

4
00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.919
所以我能做的是我能取代道具
So what I can do here
is I can replace props,

5
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.559
我知道这东西会被称为动物，品种和名称，对吧 ?
I know that the thing is gonna be
called animal, breed, and name, right?

6
00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.079
所以我就能把它拉出来所以我要把道具都删掉
So I can actually just pull this out,
so I'm gonna delete props here,

7
00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.579
把括号放在后面
put the parentheses back.

8
00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.699
然后在里面我要放大括号就像这样
And then inside of that,
I'm gonna put curly brackets, like that.

9
00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.830
然后我要说名字
And then I'm gonna say name,

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.134
像这样繁殖的动物
animal, and breed like that.

11
00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:37.399
这将会把这些特别命名的属性拉出来
And this is going to pull out these
particularly named properties within these

12
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.030
并使它们作为变量名可用，对吗 ?
objects and make them available
as those variable names, right?

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.182
所以不要说我的名字我只想说名字
So instead of saying props.name,
I'm just gonna say name.

14
00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:50.338
> > Brian Holt: 和动物一样
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same
thing here with animal,

15
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.033
>> Brian Holt: 并繁殖。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And breed.

16
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:58.661
>> Brian Holt: 有道理吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

17
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:03.603
它被称为破坏， >> Brian Holt:
It's called destructuring,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

18
00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.539
一切都应该以同样的方式运作
everything should work the same way,
which it does.

19
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:14.930
>> Brian Holt: 好， >> Brian Holt: 因此
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.981
那是第一部分
that's the first section.

21
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.730
恭喜你你知道现在有点反应了
So congratulations,
you know a little bit of React now.

22
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.587
好消息是它是最重要的。
And the good news is this
is kind of most of it.

23
00:01:21.587 --> 00:01:23.801
我要给你们看一堆其他的东西，对吧 ?
I'm going to show you a bunch
of other stuff, right?

24
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:27.144
我得赚他们付我的钱 [LAUGH]
I have to earn what they're
paying me [LAUGH] but

25
00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:30.668
这有点像是 React 的核心思想
this is kinda like the core
idea of what React is.

26
00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:37.137
> > Brian Holt: 所以这里有一个落实点，所以如果你落后了
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a commit point
here, so if you're falling behind and

27
00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:40.651
你想站在这一点上你就能在第一次
you wanna come up to this point, you can
actually just move to the first commit in

28
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.439
这就把你带到车间里去了
the repo, and this will take you
to this point in the workshop.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.150
接下来我们要做的就是开始引入一些工具
The next thing we're gonna do is we're
going to start introducing some tooling to

30
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.680
救我们出去
help us out.

31
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.289
因为你不想这么写
Because you don't wanna
write React like this,

32
00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.569
你可以让 React 更容易写作
you can actually make React
much easier to write.

33
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.299
但是，这还是雷法的核心概念。
But again, this is still the core
concepts of what React is.

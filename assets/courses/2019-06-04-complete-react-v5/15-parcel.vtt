00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.879
> > Brian Holt: 我想说的关于包裹的第一件事是我教过，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the first thing I wanna
say about Parcel is that I have taught,

2
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.890
在这类的历史上，我教了 Webpack 和 Webpack 是一个非常棒的工具。
historically in this class, I have taught
Webpack and Webpack is a phenomenal tool.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.839
它也是 OpenJS 基金会的一部分。
It is part of
the OpenJS Foundation as well.

4
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.875
Fronend Masters 有个不错的课程
There is a great course in
Frontend Masters about it.

5
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:20.660
如果你想学习 Webpack 和 React ，我就用 React V3 教它。
If you wanna learn Webpack and
React together I teach it with React V3.

6
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.829
如果你想看看那还真是太有效了
And that's still totally valid
if you wanna check that out.

7
00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.260
但我今天要用另一个包裹
But I'm gonna use a different
packager today that is called Parcel.

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.729
我选择跟派塞尔一起教的原因是它非常的手断。
The reason why I chose to teach with
Parcel is it's extremely hands-off.

9
00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.030
你只要把它指向一个文件
You just point it at a file and

10
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.719
它只是把它自己的一切都做出来了
it just kind of figures it
everything out by itself.

11
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.299
它没有配置。
There's no configuration to it.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.929
Webpack 是惊人的。
Webpack is phenomenal.

13
00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.469
它超级强大。
It's super powerful.

14
00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.049
如果你有你需要做的事
If you have crazy things
you need to do with it,

15
00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.420
Webpack 是你的朋友在做这些疯狂的事情。
Webpack is your friend in
doing crazy stuff like that.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.409
但要建立起来有点困难
But it's kinda difficult to set up.

17
00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.969
权力很复杂是必然的，对吧 ?
It's inevitable that with
power comes complexity, right?

18
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.780
所以说我喜欢这两种工具
So suffice to say I love both tools.

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.670
我只是选择今天的包裹我们就能集中精力
I'm just choosing Parcel today so
that we can focus on React and

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.700
不一定集中在捆束器上
not necessarily focus on the bundler.

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.420
我们现在要做的是我们会说晚上晚上会装 D 包的
What we're gonna do now is we're gonna say
npm install D parcel- bundler like that.

22
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.896
那只需要第二个 cuz 就有很多东西了
That one takes a second cuz there's
a lot of stuff that comes with it.

23
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.195
>> Brian Holt: 这是将每个代码捆绑在一起的实际工具，并且
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the actual tool
that will bundle every code together, and

24
00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:38.192
准备好了
get it ready.

25
00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:41.280
1 表示开发环境， 2 表示生产环境。
1 for your development environment,
and 2 for production.

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.620
而且真的很聪明
And it's really smart.

27
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.719
你把它指向你的索引 html 文件
You just point it at
your index html file and

28
00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.879
它通过找出所有路径来发现所有路径
it discovers all the paths just
by figuring everything out.

29
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.650
它就像这是一个 TypeScript 文件，或者是一个 JavaScript
And it figures out like this is
a TypeScript file, or this is a JavaScript

30
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.939
文件，或者这是一个 CSS 文件，它对您的所有内容都是灵活的。
file, or this is a CSS file and it just
neatly packages everything for you.

31
00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.706
这是一个令人印象深刻的工具。
It's a pretty impressive tool.

32
00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:08.414
>> Brian Holt: 我实际上经常使用它。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's one I
actually I use quite frequently.

33
00:02:08.414 --> 00:02:11.016
背包和包裹都值得支持
And both Webpack and
Parcel definitely worth supporting.

34
00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:15.009
他们都有开放的收藏者，所以你会有自己的倾向。
They both have open collectors, so
that's something you feel inclined to do.

35
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.189
你可以看到他们在那里为你删除了一个链接。
You can see that they actually
drop a link in there for you.

36
00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:23.670
>> Brian Holt: Frontend Masters ，感谢 Frontend Masters。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Frontend Masters does,
thanks Frontend Masters.

37
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.646
> > Brian Holt: 好的，既然我们已经这样做了，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now that we've done that,

38
00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:33.319
我要你去你的包里
I want you to go into your package.json.

39
00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.762
我们将在这里添加另一个将是 dev的脚本。
And we're going to add another script
in here that's going to be dev.

40
00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:48.020
>> Brian Holt: 这将显示包裹 src/index.html。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is gonna say parcel src/index.html.

41
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.884
所以你和 Parcel 要做的就是把它点在 index.html 上
So again, all you have to do with Parcel
is you just point it at the index.html

42
00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.391
把所有东西都给你
file and
it just figures everything else for you.

43
00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:04.419
>> Brian Holt: 现在我可以进入我的收养了。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now I can go into my adopt me.

44
00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.789
首先我想说的是
Well, so first thing I wanna mention here.

45
00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.485
这让我很困惑，直到有人把它指向我。
This was confusing to me for a long
time until someone pointed it out to me.

46
00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:13.120
就像我一样，它怎么知道包裹是什么，对吧 ?
As I was like,
how does it know what parcel is, right?

47
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.229
我觉得这里没有包裹是吧
I don't think I have parcel
available here, right,

48
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.590
它说找不到包裹指令
it says parcel command not found.

49
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.629
就像它是怎么知道的
So like how does it know that?

50
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.289
如果您在此处的节点模块中使用，即所有节点所在的位置，
Well if you go inside of your node modules
here, which is where all of your node,

51
00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:26.900
当我说 npm 安装捆绑软件时，它就会进入节点模块。
when I say npm install bundle there,
that's where it goes into node modules.

52
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.159
还有一个秘书目录她
And there is a secret.bin directory her.

53
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.269
我能用的各种不同的二进制工具
Of all the various different
binary tools I can use, right?

54
00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.900
其中一个在这里叫做包裹，它连接到包裹式的捆绑器。
And one of them in here is called parcel,
which is connected to parcel-bundler.

55
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.786
所以它就是这样找到的
So that's how it finds it.

56
00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:54.292
>> Brian Holt: Echo 不在这里，例如， Echo只是像麦克一样的一部分。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Echo's not in here right,
for example, Echo's just part of like Mac.

57
00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:58.490
但它能在这里找到包裹和漂亮的
But it is able to find parcel and
prettier in here.

58
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.157
所以，就这样，你就知道了，这就是如何连接在一起的。
So, just so you know that that's
how that gets connected together.

59
00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:06.365
>> Brian Holt: 现在我可以说， npm 运行 dev。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now I can say, npm run dev.

60
00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:10.990
> > 布莱恩 - 霍特( Brian Holt ) : 它会把所有东西都放在一起。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's gonna build all the stuff together.

61
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.740
它在 1.76 秒后就已经准备好了。
And it's ready in 1.76 seconds.

62
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.300
你可以看到这里有一个 dist 和一个 .cache 的导演。
You can see here that there's now
a dist and a .cache director.

63
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.639
这是 Parcel 为你创造的
That is something that Parcel creates for
you.

64
00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.134
你可以基本上忽略它，现在我可以打开了。
You can just basically ignore it,
and I can open now.

65
00:04:23.134 --> 00:04:26.519
所以如果我 Cmd + click 此，它将在我的浏览器中打开。
So if I Cmd + click this,
it'll open in my browser.

66
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.048
你可以看到，神奇的是，我正在使用 localhost:1234 ，但是
And you can see, magically,
I'm running on localhost:1234, but

67
00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:32.824
现在包裹被包裹包裹
now this is being packaged by Parcel.

68
00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:38.250
> > Brian Holt: 现在有一些很酷的东西。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now there's some
pretty cool stuff about this.

69
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.941
如果我进入 app.js 和
If I go into app.js and

70
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:44.168
我改变了这个， > > Brian Holt: 我不知道，
I change this to be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know,

71
00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:47.058
在这里再加上一个 " 收养我 " 我就省了这个
maybe add another Adopt Me in here,
and I save this.

72
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.240
它会自动刷新我的页面。
It automatically refreshes my page for
you.

73
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.154
因此，它会为您提供免费的热模型刷新。
So it does a hot model refresh for
you out of the box for free.

74
00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:55.478
你不用做任何事都是有用的
You don't have to do anything about it,
it just works.

75
00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:02.334
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's really it,

76
00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.595
我们不会再配置包裹了
we're not gonna configure
parcel anymore than that.

77
00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.038
它很聪明就能找到其他的东西
It's smart enough to figure
everything else out.

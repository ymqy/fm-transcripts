00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:03.419
> > Brian Holt: 现在我们要在这里写一些代码。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now we're gonna write some code in here.

2
00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.429
而不是我们的剧本我要说康斯特
Instead of our script tag,
I'm gonna say const.

3
00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.640
应用程序。
App.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.451
等于一个箭头函数。
Equals an arrow function.

5
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:19.410
>> 布莱恩 - 霍尔特: 所以你们中的一些人可能被这个象形文字所迷思了。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So some of you might be
mystified by this hieroglyphic here.

6
00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.420
这就是所谓的字体结扎。
This is what's called a font ligature.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.480
所以我有个特别的字体来让它很美
So, I have a special font to make
it beautiful that I've installed

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.059
当我有一些彼此相邻的角色时，它将它们组合在一起。
that when I have certain characters that
are next to each other, it combines them.

9
00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.770
很漂亮所以我才这么做
It's pretty, so that's why I do it.

10
00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.369
它的认知开销也不如一个字符，而不是两个字符。
It also supposedly less cognitive overhead
parts one character instead of two.

11
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:39.329
Blah ， blah， blah.
Blah, blah, blah.

12
00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.280
我这么做是因为我觉得它看起来不错
I do it because I think it looks nice.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.936
所以如果我把空间放在这里，你会看到它实际上是在等号和
So if I put space here, you'll see
that it's actually in equal signs and

14
00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:48.390
一个角度的支架但是如果你把它们放在一起的话
an angle bracket, but
if you put them together it's get that.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.969
所以我要尽快给你展示我经常被问到的
So I'm just gonna show you very quickly
how to do that cuz I frequently get asked

16
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.219
我怎么才能得到这个
on how do I get that for myself.

17
00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.906
我用的这个字体的名字叫 Dank Mono。
The name of this font that I'm
using is called Dank Mono.

18
00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.085
我没说这就是它的名字
I didn't name it,
that's exactly what it's called.

19
00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:06.099
在 Dank.sh，这些优秀的人实际上赞助了并置或
At Dank.sh, these wonderful people
actually sponsored concatenate or

20
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.109
我们的会议对他们大喊大叫
our conference so shout out to them.

21
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.206
这是一个 50 美元的字体为了现在的 40 磅
This is a $50 font for
the sake it's 40 pounds now,

22
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.743
大概是五十多块吧
which is I guess more than $50.

23
00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:20.284
如果你愿意的话你可以得到这个
So you can get that if you want to.

24
00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:21.966
你花了很多时间看字体
You spent a lot of time looking at font,
so

25
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.965
这可能是我无法从这件事中得到的教训
that might be something to consider I
get no kick back from this by the way.

26
00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:26.013
我只是个粉丝
I'm just a fan.

27
00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:28.774
但是如果你不想付钱
But, if you don't wanna pay for one,

28
00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:32.579
还有一个叫 FILA 的代码是免费的
there's another one called
FIRA Code that is free.

29
00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:38.758
>> Brian Holt: 这个很好的人已经为你做了这件事。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this very nice
person has done that for you.

30
00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:41.560
有办法安装它。
And there are ways to install it.

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.180
所以如何安装，你可以把它弄下来。
So how to install,
you can get that down here.

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.859
我把它关掉了是很容易做到的
I got it off which is
the easy way to do it.

33
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.329
因此， < 刑法 > 将是另一个。
So, FiraCode would be the other one.

34
00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.420
好的，一旦你安装了其中一个，你就会把它放进去
Okay, so once you have one of those
installed, the way that you put that into

35
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.590
VS 码是我要打开我的设置
VS code is, I'm gonna open my settings so,
preferences,

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.209
或者您可以使用命令逗号来命中命令，无论窗口是什么。
settings here, or you can hit command
comma, whatever that would be for windows.

37
00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.400
好吧那你得换两件事情
Okay, so you have to change two things.

38
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.770
你必须改变的是你的战线
One of them you have to
change is your front.

39
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.960
在这里我第一次和菲拉法第二次
So here, I have Dank Mono first and
FiraCode second,

40
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.930
它就像一个 CSS 的权利，所以它会得到我能找到的第一个，好的。
it works just like a CSS right, so it'll
get the first one that I can find, okay.

41
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.150
然后你可以看到这里的编辑字体
And then you can see here
Editor Font Ligatures,

42
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.969
你也得让这一点
you have to enable that as well.

43
00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.579
好，这样就可以让角色的实际结合了。
Right, so that'll allow the actual
combining of characters.

44
00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.621
所以如果我回去了别救了
So if I go back to, don't save

45
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:42.135
在我的， >> Brian Holt:
over my,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So like

46
00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:47.180
如果我现在就把它关掉，你可以看到我有这个箭头。
if I were to turn off ligatures right now,
you can see here that I have this arrow.

47
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.199
但如果我把它关掉， >> Brian Holt: 你会发现
But if I turned it off,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You'll see that it gets

48
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.872
又分开了
separated again.

49
00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.329
那就好
So, cool.

50
00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.810
这就是你的连接方式。
So that's how you enable ligatures.

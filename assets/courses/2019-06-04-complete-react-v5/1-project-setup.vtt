00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
>> 布莱恩: 当我非常，非常第一次学习 React的时候，
&gt;&gt; Brian: When I was very,
very first learning React,

2
00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:05.123
其实我第一次看到 React 的时候我觉得很恶心
actually the very first time I saw React,
I thought it was gross.

3
00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:08.695
我觉得很恶心，因为为什么我要把 HTML 放在我的 JavaScript里 ?
I thought it was gross because why would
I wanna put HTML inside my JavaScript?

4
00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:11.643
我为什么要用这种额外的错位语言
Why would I wanna have this
extra transpiled language?

5
00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:15.272
我有一堆很奇怪的感觉
There was a bunch of really weird
feelings that I got about it, and

6
00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:19.634
我把所有的情绪都推倒了，这就是我的心理医生告诉我要做的。
I just pushed all the feelings down,
which was what my therapist told me to do.

7
00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:23.219
不是的我开玩笑的别这样
That's not, I'm kidding, don't do that.

8
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.740
但我要向你解释为什么我觉得这些事都很好
But I'm going to explain to you why
I think those things are okay, but

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.801
我们要从没有转换步骤开始，没有 JSX。
we're going to start with no
transpolation step, no JSX.

10
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.432
没有婴儿没有包裹没有包裹
No babble, no web pack, no parcel.

11
00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.094
什么都没有
Nothing like that.

12
00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:37.350
我们将会编写原始 JavaScript React ，向您展示它是有可能的。
We're going to be writing raw JavaScript
React just to show you that it's possible.

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.229
我希望有人能这样教导我因为你会看到 JX
And I wish someone would have taught it to
me like this because you'll see that JSX

14
00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.115
React 不做任何黑魔法
and React are not doing
any sort of black magic.

15
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:48.923
只是普通的旧 JavaScript 函数调用
It's just regular old
JavaScript function calls, and

16
00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.975
我认为你想了解你的工具
it's my opinion that you want
to understand your tooling,

17
00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:57.689
如果你不了解你的工具然后重新发送它们，对吧 ?
cuz if you don't understand your tools and
you resent them, right?

18
00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.651
因为它们似乎增加了复杂性。
Because they just seem to add complexity.

19
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.881
但如果您了解这些工具所解决的问题，
But if you understand the problem
that the tools are solving,

20
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.748
你就会接受复杂性因为它让你易于使用，对吗 ?
then you embrace the complexity because
it gives you ease of use, right?

21
00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:11.903
JX 是我的问题，我对它感到不满，因为我不理解它。
So that was kinda my problem with JSX is
I resented it cuz I didn't understand it.

22
00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:15.692
希望我能教你怎么做然后你就能明白为什么
So hopefully here I can teach you what it
does and then you can understand why it

23
00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.972
存在，因为这样写 React 真的很烦人。
exists, because it's really
annoying to write React like this.

24
00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:21.033
但你可以
But you can.

25
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:26.403
好吧我要你做什么我要去我的桌面
Okay, so what I want you to do,
I'm just gonna go to my desktop,

26
00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:29.192
我要去做个目录
and I'm gonna make a directory.

27
00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:34.334
其实就是这样说，我就说，
Actually, even just do it this way,
I'll just say,

28
00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:41.673
新文件夹就会被称为 " 我的项目" 。
New folder right there, and this is
going to be called the adopt me project.

29
00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:42.620
请选择其他名称。
Choose a different name.

30
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.496
那我就把那个删了
Well, I'm just gonna delete that one then.

31
00:01:47.944 --> 00:01:49.439
> > 布莱恩: 好的，搬去 " 废纸篓"
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right, move to Trash.

32
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.621
好吧好吧
All right.

33
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:52.643
这一款将被称为收养
This one is going to be called adopt-me,

34
00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:55.197
这才是我们今天要做的
cuz that's going to be
what we're building today.

35
00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:58.730
宠物收养应用程序。
A pet adoption application.

36
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.164
好了我要用 Visual Studio 代码打开它
Okay, and then I'm going to open
this with Visual Studio Code.

37
00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:10.485
>> 布莱恩: 好的。
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right.

38
00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:18.360
> > 布莱恩: 好的，所以现在我在这个文件夹里没有任何东西。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now I'm inside of
this adopt-me folder with nothing in it.

39
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.584
我要在这里创造一个新目录
I'm gonna create a new
directory inside of here.

40
00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:26.317
因此， SRC 是我刚刚创建的目录的名称。
So it's gonna be, SRC is the name of
the directory that I just created.

41
00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:29.263
你没有理由这样做一个 React 项目。
There's no reason you have to
structure a React project this way.

42
00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:31.998
这只是我习惯写代码的一种方式。
This is just a way that I'm
habituated to writing code.

43
00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:36.715
好吧在这里我要创建一个新的文件
So okay, inside of here I'm
gonna create a new file, and

44
00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.776
它会被称为 index.html
it's gonna be called index.html.

45
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.471
> > 布莱恩: 现在我要给你看的第一个窍门
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now the first trick
here that I'm gonna show you

46
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.905
" Visual Studio Code " 是一个叫艾美特的小东西
with Visual Studio Code is
a little thing called Emmet.

47
00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:54.156
所以如果我把 html : 5，你可以看到我有这个自动完成的自动完成，
So if I put html:5, and you can see that I
have this auto completion coming out, and

48
00:02:54.156 --> 00:03:00.167
如果我点击 Tab 键，它就会自动完成，就像 HTML 文件的支架一样。
if I hit Tab, it's going to autocomplete
out to like a scaffold of the HTML file.

49
00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:04.086
因为我记不起需要进入 HTML 文件的所有东西，对吗 ?
Because I can't remember everything that
needs to go into an HTML file, right?

50
00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:08.805
我每次都要把它给谷歌
I literally have to Google this
every single time that I do it,

51
00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:10.906
所以才这么做
so that's what that does.

52
00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:14.433
我会在继续使用 Emmet 的同时，我也会把它叫做 " Emet " 。
And I'll be using Emmet a little bit more
as we go on, and I'll call it out so

53
00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:17.860
您可以看到它，但是您可以看到整个备忘单 @emmet.io。
you can see it, but you can see that
the entire cheat sheet @emmet.io.

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.740
你可以把 Emmet 放到Sub石灰里
It's not something that VS code invented,
so you can put Emmet into Sublime and

55
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.506
JetBrains 之类的东西，但它是内置在球棒上的。
JetBrains and stuff like that,
but it is built-in off the bat.

56
00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:30.756
好的我会的这就叫 ADOPTme 了
Okay, and I'm gonna,
this is gonna be called ADOPTme, so

57
00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:32.287
这就是我要称呼的名字
that's what I'm gonna call the title.

58
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:39.039
> > 布莱恩: 好的，在身体里，我要放几个标签。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so here inside the body,
I'm gonna put a couple of tags.

59
00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.832
第一个是我要放一个叫 root的人
The first one is I'm gonna
put one called root.

60
00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:44.915
所以你可以给我写根的 css 选择器
So you can there I just wrote
the css selector for root,

61
00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:46.867
我想当个迪夫对吧
which I wanted to be a div, right?

62
00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:53.034
所以我做了 #root，然后我点击 Tab 键，然后它就能完成到一个区。
So I do #root, and then I hit Tab, and
it's gonna complete that out to a div.

63
00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:55.674
现在你知道 Emmet 更复杂了
Now just so you know Emmet is
way more complicated that,

64
00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:57.311
你可以和艾美特一起做疯狂的事
you can do crazy stuff with Emmet.

65
00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:02.329
我就像偷懒的缩写大部分都是这样
I just use like the lazy abbreviations,
that's mostly it.

66
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.097
好的，所以我把 div 作为一个路线的概念，我不会把它放进去。
Okay, so I have div as an idea of route,
I'm gonna put not rendered inside of that.

67
00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:12.830
我这样做的原因是，如果我看到没有呈现，我知道 React
Reason why I do that is because if I
see not rendered I know that the React

68
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.424
应用程序未启动。
application didn't start.

69
00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:18.584
但如果它启动了，它就会取代这个区的所有东西。
But if it did start, then it's going to
replace everything inside of this div.

70
00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:26.249
>> 布莱恩: 好的，在这个下面我要放两个脚本标签
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, underneath this,
I'm gonna put two script tags, so

71
00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.211
我要把 script:src ，就这样
I'm gonna put script:src, like that.

72
00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:35.019
>> Brian: 它自动完成到脚本标记。
&gt;&gt; Brian: It autocomplete
out to a script tag.

73
00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:37.956
我们会把两个 URL 放在这里
And we're gonna put two URLs here.

74
00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:45.706
其中一个将是 https://unpkg.com。
So one of them is gonna
be https://unpkg.com.

75
00:04:47.963 --> 00:04:51.928
>> Brian: 这是 NPM 软件包的 CDN ，这只是一种时髦的说法
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is a CDN for NPM packages,
which is just a fancy way of saying

76
00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:56.042
有一堆我会解包的 JavaScript 文件
that there's a bunch of JavaScript
files that I'll unpackage and

77
00:04:56.042 --> 00:04:58.697
它会把这些从 mpm 的注册中拉出来
it'll pull these off of the mpm registry.

78
00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:03.795
所以我要从登记册上撤下雷法
So I'm gonna pull off of the registry,
React, and

79
00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:09.369
我要去找个特定版本的
I'm gonna grab a specific version,
so 16.8.4,

80
00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:15.074
我认为 6 是这个拍摄的最新版本。
I think 6 is the latest version
as of the filming of this.

81
00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:18.524
但我们要坚持 4 号因为我所有的笔记都在用 4
But we're gonna stick with 4 because
all my notes are using 4, so

82
00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:20.076
我们还是继续吧
let's just stick with that.

83
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.559
>> Brian: 好的， React to
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and React to

84
00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:33.000
16.8.4/umd/reet.development.js.
16.8.4/umd/react.development.js.

85
00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:39.983
> > 布莱恩: 那么这事要做的，就是去 CDN，
&gt;&gt; Brian: So what this is gonna do,
this is gonna go out to the CDN,

86
00:05:39.983 --> 00:05:44.192
请抓取该文件，该文件是已编译的 React 文件，并且
grab this file which is
a compiled React file, and

87
00:05:44.192 --> 00:05:50.620
它会将此作为顶级 React 变量装入，因此您可以使用 React。
it's going to load this as a top level
React variable, so you can use React.

88
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.728
好吧我们需要另外一个
Okay, we're gonna need
another one of this.

89
00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:57.340
所以我要复制这件然后再把它贴在下面
So I'm going to copy this and
paste it underneath it again, and

90
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.778
那我要换两件事情
then I need to change two things.

91
00:05:59.778 --> 00:06:03.067
其中一个是在提出这种反应的时候
One of them here the React
when put this react-dom,

92
00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:07.927
比如， >> 布莱恩: 然后我也在上面写着
like that,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then I'm also where it says

93
00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:13.021
再反反派我要把它的反应做个反应
react.development.js, I'm gonna put
react-dom.development.js, right?

94
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:14.855
所以我在两个地方改变了这个
So I changed this in two places.

95
00:06:21.552 --> 00:06:22.110
> > 布莱恩: 好吗 ? 而且
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?
And

96
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.305
这将会加载一个第二个图书馆，
this is going to load a second library,
which is going to be the react-dom

97
00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.048
库，它允许您呈现浏览器并对其作出反应。
library, which allows you to render and
react to the browser.

98
00:06:28.048 --> 00:06:29.586
为什么有两个包裹呢 ?
Now why is there two packages?

99
00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:31.995
看起来有点困惑对吧
That seems a little confusing, right?

100
00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:35.483
你们中的一些人可能熟悉名为 " React Native" 的项目。
Well, some of you may be familiar
with the project called React Native.

101
00:06:35.483 --> 00:06:38.659
因此， React Native and ReactDOM 都共享 React 软件包。
So React Native and
ReactDOM both share the React package.

102
00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.581
这一反应就像
This React is just like,

103
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:45.894
它是一个非常小的 2 千字节的包装，说明如何与 React 交互。
it's a very small 2 kilobyte package
of how to interact with React.

104
00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:49.314
所以它有你要调用的所有顶级方法
So it has all of the top level
methods that you're going to call, and

105
00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:53.334
那么 ReactDOM 实际上是把所有东西都从 React 中取出来的
then ReactDOM is actually the large one
that takes all that stuff out of the React

106
00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:55.321
打包并将其呈现给浏览器。
package and renders it to the browser.

107
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:57.632
根据同一令牌，您将装入 React ，并且
By the same token you would load React,
and

108
00:06:57.632 --> 00:07:01.432
然后， React Native 会将其装入到 Android 或 iOS 应用程序中。
then React Native would actually load
it into your Android or iOS app.

109
00:07:01.432 --> 00:07:02.490
有道理吗
Does it make sense?

110
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.363
好的。
Okay.

111
00:07:03.363 --> 00:07:05.384
这就是为什么那里有两种不同的包装。
So that's why there's two
different packages there.

112
00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:11.189
> > 布莱恩: 在我们要放置第三个脚本标签的下面，
&gt;&gt; Brian: Underneath that we're
gonna put a third script tag, and

113
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.901
我们会做你不该做的事
we're gonna do what you should never do,

114
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:18.105
我们要用 HTML 直接写 JavaScript
which is we're going to write
JavaScript directly in our HTML.

115
00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:22.720
我告诉你怎么做是因为我想告诉你
Now the reason why I showed you how to do
this is because I wanted to show you that

116
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.137
这可能是超光秃秃的对吧
this can be super bare-bones, right?

117
00:07:25.137 --> 00:07:29.471
我们会把它修好但现在我只想让你写这个
We're gonna fix this in a little bit but
for now I just want you to write this,

118
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:31.187
你的密码就会在这里
your code is going to go here.

119
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.471

&gt;&gt; Brian: For now.

120
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.202
好了别这样了
Oops, stop that.

121
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:44.332
>> 布莱恩: 现在我做了这个，保存这个文件，对吗 ?

我要找到 ADOPTme ， source和 index.html。
I'm going to find ADOPTme,
source, and index.html.

129
00:08:16.985 --> 00:08:18.605
我在我的浏览器中打开了这个
And I opened this in my browser.

130
00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:24.653
> > 布莱恩: 你应该看到一些没有呈现的东西，对吧 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian: And you should see something
that says not rendered, right?

131
00:08:24.653 --> 00:08:26.053
因为我们还没做任何事
Because we haven't actually
done anything yet.

132
00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:27.764
我们刚装了图书馆
We've just loaded the libraries.

133
00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:35.554
> > 布莱恩: 但是我要在这里打开我的控制台。
&gt;&gt; Brian: But
I'm gonna open my console here.

134
00:08:35.554 --> 00:08:36.379
这有点大
This a bit bigger.

135
00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:38.529
你不用这么做我只是在给你看
You don't have to do this,
I'm just showing you.

136
00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:41.669
如果我在控制台里呆着我说 " 雷法"
If I go in here in my console,
and I say React,

137
00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.332
因为我们装了这个，对吧 ?
now this is defined because
we loaded that, right?

138
00:08:45.332 --> 00:08:46.624
使用其中一个脚本标记。
With one of the script tags.

139
00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:49.351
和 ReactDOM一样
Same thing here with ReactDOM,

140
00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:53.703
也因为我们把它从 CDN 中装入了
also defined because we
loaded this off of the CDN.

141
00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:57.821
让人感觉所有这些都是垂直的，很酷。
Makes sense of how all that's
is plumbed together, cool.

142
00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:04.863
>> 布莱恩: 好的。
&gt;&gt; Brian: All right.

143
00:09:04.863 --> 00:09:09.116
我接下来要你做的就是去拿 CSS
The next thing I want you to do
is we're gonna go grab the CSS.

144
00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:13.763
这绝对不是 CSS 的问题，所以我们给所有 CSS 预先写了
This is definitely not a course about CSS,
so we prewrote all the CSS for

145
00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:16.327
你这样你就不用写了
you, so that you don't have to write.

146
00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:19.513
所以如果你遵循我们的约定和命名模式
So if you just follow our conventions and
naming patterns,

147
00:09:19.513 --> 00:09:21.880
你会免费得到所有造型的
you're gonna get all the styling for free.

148
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.761
我不想让你们看这个 CSS 或者
And I'm not telling any of
you to look at the CSS or

149
00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:27.517
应该是你写 CSS的方法
think it's the way that
you should write CSS.

150
00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:33.875
CSS没有任何评论。
There's no commentary
intended from the CSS.

151
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:39.027
所以如果你进了课你就会看到
So if you go here into the class notes,
you're gonna see here

152
00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:44.481
大约三分之一的时间，您需要抓取 CSS 文件。
about a third of the way down,
you'll need to grab the CSS file.

153
00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:47.213
我们写了这样你就不用在这里下载了
We wrote it so
you don't have to download it here.

154
00:09:47.213 --> 00:09:50.761
事实上坦纳写的很感谢你坦纳
And actually, Tanner wrote it so
thank you, Tanner.

155
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:54.721
因此，如果您在此处单击 " 下载 " ，那么它应将您转至该文件，
So if you click Download it here,
it should take you to this file,

156
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:57.539
你可以看到它在 GitHub上
you can see here it's
actually on the GitHub.

157
00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:06.604
> > 布莱恩: 我要点击命令 A，选择所有内容，并将其复制。
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I'm just gonna hit command
A, select everything, and copy it.

158
00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:12.118
然后我要回到我的项目上
And then I'm going to go back
over to my project here,

159
00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:16.532
在源目录中创建新文件，
create a new file in the source directory,

160
00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:22.673
叫 style.css ，并将所有业务粘贴到该文件中。
called style.css, and
paste all that business in there.

161
00:10:22.673 --> 00:10:24.847
省省吧
And Save it.

162
00:10:24.847 --> 00:10:29.193
好了我要把它放在头标签里
Okay, here inside of the head
tag I'm gonna put link,

163
00:10:29.193 --> 00:10:34.880
我要把这一切都结束了我要把它放在一起
which is going to complete out to this,
and I'm gonna put /style.css

164
00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:43.528
> > Brian: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

165
00:10:43.528 --> 00:10:47.570
所以现在我们应该可以回到我们的 ADOPTme
So now, we should be able
to go back to our ADOPTme,

166
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.336
刷新页面现在它看起来好多了
refresh the page, and
now it looks a lot nicer.

167
00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:55.197
背景中只有很少的鸡和甲壳虫，这很令人愉快。
It's got little chickens and beetles
in the background, it's very pleasant.

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.270
>> Brian Holt: 恭喜。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Congratulations.

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.819
你学会了 React
You have learned React.

3
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:09.237
我说我教了你 95 % 的
I would say I taught you
probably 95% of what's

4
00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:15.301
React 的有用信息，可能是所有 React的 80% 。
useful about React and
probably 80% of all of React.

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:17.899
这其实是我喜欢的事情之一
And this is actually one of
the things that I like about it is

6
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.190
你可以把所有 React 都保留在你的头上对吧
that you can keep all of
React in your head, right?

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.800
它是一个相当小的图书馆，仅仅是原始的学习概念。
It's a fairly small library,
in terms of just raw concepts to learn.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.050
而这就是我和 Angular 合作的时候的批评
Whereas this was my criticism with
Angular when I was working with it,

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.519
你不可能知道所有角
you can't know all of Angular.

10
00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.620
这太重要了
It's just too big.

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.549
有太多的问题你不能一直保持在你的脑子里
There's just too much that it does and
you can't keep that all in your head.

12
00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.579
那就好，有很多很酷的东西，和安珀一样，对吧 ?
That's fine, it does a lot of really
cool stuff, and same with Ember, right?

13
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.170
知道如何写 " 安珀 " 的人能够非常地相信
People that know how to write Ember
are able to scath out really incredible

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.920
项目。
projects.

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.716
我很欣赏他们的生产力
I admire them for
how productive they can be.

16
00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:51.482
但我不太仔细地看 " React " ，因为它是
But I don't really look at the React aux
very much because it's something that if

17
00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:54.520
你做得够多了就像坐在你脑袋里一样
you do enough,
it just kinda all sits in your head.

18
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.420
所以我写了一段很长时间的 React 。
So I've written React for a long time.

19
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.210
我是个大粉丝
I'm a big fan.

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.765
即使我不是在写作，我通常是在写 < 普雷法> 。
Even when I'm not writing React,
I'm usually writing Preact.

21
00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:06.439
所以，之前的课程版本，我教了什么 Preact ， js 是什么。
[LAUGH] So, previous versions of this
course, I taught what Preact,js is.

22
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.536
这很可能值得我们去看看
It's something probably
worth checking out.

23
00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:11.840
我今天不教它因为 Preact 总是落后于人
I'm not gonna teach it today because
Preact always lags behind React a little

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.269
，所以他们还没有准备好挂钩，上次我看的时候。
bit, and so they're still not ready
with hooks, last time I checked.

25
00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:16.299
他们现在可能是但
They might be now, but.

26
00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.299
如果你想写雷法
If you wanna write React but

27
00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.439
如果只使用 3 千字节 ( 而不是 35 千字节 ) ，那么 Preact 将执行此操作。
have it only use 3 kilobytes instead
of 35 kilobytes, Preact will do that.

28
00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.689
所以它是一个较小的，通常较慢的库，
So it's a smaller,
typically slower library,

29
00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.030
一旦它执行，下载速度也会更快。
once it's executing, but
it's also faster to download.

30
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.890
因此，如果您尝试将 2G 网络和之类的内容作为目标，那么这一点非常有用。
So this is really useful if you're trying
to target 2G networks and stuff like that.

31
00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.317
好消息是它的运作方式几乎完全一样。
And the good news is it works
almost exactly the same way.

32
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:48.932
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特: 其实是到时时之间，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's actually
to the point where oftentimes,

33
00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:53.414
你可以直接掉在 Preact ，这很酷，就可以了。
you can actually just drop in Preact,
which is pretty cool, and it'll just work.

34
00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:07.170
>> 布莱恩 - 霍尔特: 太棒了，那就是 " 复行 " 的结尾。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah great, so
that is the end of the intro to React.

35
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.740
再教这个太有趣了
This was so fun to teach this again.

36
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.430
这是我最喜欢的教学工作坊之一所以我做了这五个
It's one of my favorite workshop to teach,
hence, why I've done this five and

37
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.849
半天， [ LAUGH]。
a half times, [LAUGH].

38
00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.899
如果他们不把我扔出去我估计也会再回来的
And I probably will be back again,
if they don't throw me out.

39
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.740
也很缓慢的更新。
It's also pretty slow to update as well.

40
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.707
在这种感觉中
In the sense of like,

41
00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:29.829
五年前的反应还是和我们今天写的差不多。
the React of five years ago is still
pretty similar to what we write today.

42
00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.670
我觉得写一个项目是个很好的方法
And yeah, I think it's a good
way to write a project.

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.870
所以这里有很多美好的地方。
So there's a lot of good places
where you can go from here.

44
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.240
我们将在这个项目上建立中间的 " 反应 " 。
There's intermediate React, which we'll
be building on this same project.

45
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.329
但是我们要做一些随意的事情比如情绪
But we're gonna go ahead and introduce
kind of optional things like emotion,

46
00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.969
或服务器端呈现，或 Redux，或类似的内容。
or server-side rendering, or
Redux, or things like that.

47
00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.639
你可以去参加肯特的测试课程
You can go take Kent's testing course.

48
00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.340
我在中间 React 中有一个测试模块但它是这么大的
So I have a testing module in
the intermediate React, but it's this big,

49
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.151
激烈的，肯特的课程很深入的测试。
intense, and
Kent's course is very in-depth on testing.

50
00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.526
史蒂夫有先进的国家管理
There's advanced state
management with Steve.

51
00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:09.719
而且他做的工作比雷迪克斯和莫巴克斯
And he does a great job of going
over things like Redux and MobX and

52
00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.000
有些很重的国家集装箱
some of those other very
heavy state containers.

53
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.539
然后在 FrontendMasters上还有其他很酷的东西。
And then there's just a lot of other
really cool stuff on FrontendMasters.

54
00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.500
好的谢谢你的收看
So, yeah, thanks for watching.

55
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.435
谢谢你和我一起
Thanks for sticking with me.

56
00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:26.956
>> [APPLAUSE]

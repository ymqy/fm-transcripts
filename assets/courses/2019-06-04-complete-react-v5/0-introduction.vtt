00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.009
>> Brian Holt: 欢迎使用 React V5 的完整简介，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Welcome to
the Complete Intro to React V5,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.049
我很想回来再教这个
I am stoked to be back
here teaching this again.

3
00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.480
这是我最喜欢的课程
This is my favorite course.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.374
我今天大概会重复大概 17 次，它是先知。
I'll probably repeat that like
17 times today, it's prophetic.

5
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.990
>> Brian Holt: 因此，完成 React的简介，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the complete Intro to React,

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.370
这会让整个人都喜欢写 " React"
this is gonna go over the entirety
of like how to write React.

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.259
我们把所有最新的特征都用在钩子上。
And we go over all the latest features,
which is gonna be things like hooks.

8
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.278
这将会是新的有趣的，比如上下文和
And it's gonna be all the new fun that
comes with that such as context and

9
00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:29.760
入口和各种很酷的东西
portals and
all sorts of really cool stuff.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.890
并从这一课程的第四版更新其中的一些内容。
And updating some of those things
from the version four of this course.

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.682
而且还会有一些其他的 API 类，比如类和
As well it's gonna be going over some
of the other APIs like classes and

12
00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.051
生命周期之类的事情
life cycles and things like that.

13
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:45.134
这样你就能搞定所有这些东西了
So you get a handle on
all that kind of stuff.

14
00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:49.862
我想让你做的第一件事就是我要你这么做
The first thing I want you to do is,
I want you to head to this bit.ly so

15
00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:53.637
B I T L Y / rect-v5 ，并应在此页面上降落。
B I T L Y /react-v5 and
should land on this page here.

16
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.070
你知道的这些是我的课程笔记
Just so you know,
these are my course notes,

17
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.258
这就是我们要做的事
this is what we're gonna be going over.

18
00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:02.435
所以我在这里还有一个表面，就是我在这里的一切。
So I have another Surface right here,
that's all I have up here.

19
00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.843
所以如果你落后了或者你得去约会
So if you fall behind or
you need to come up to date or

20
00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:09.429
任何类似的东西你都能读完
anything like that,
you can just read this as well.

21
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.067
好吗 ?
Okay?

22
00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:16.900
>> Brian Holt: So >> Brian Holt: You
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

23
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.810
不要把这个课程的前几个版本看在 V5，
do not have to have taken the previous
versions of this course to watch V5,

24
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.859
对这就是第五次的第五次迭代
right this is actually it's V5 in
the sense that it's the fifth iteration.

25
00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.579
所以你从零开始，你不用看其他的人来这里。
So you start from zero, you don't have to
watch any of the other ones to get here.

26
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.479
但是，如果您需要讨论 Web 包， V3 实际上仍然有用。
That being said, V3 actually is still
useful if you need to talk about web pack.

27
00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.430
如果您需要对路由器进行对话，或者
If you need to talk about react router, or

28
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.349
任何东西， V3 的一切都还是很重要的。
any of those things, everything in
V3 is still very much up to date.

29
00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:46.758
所以，如果你还需要这些东西的话，那就在外面。
So that's out there if you need
some of those things as well.

30
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:50.229
>> Brian Holt: 这主要是模块化的，对吧 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is meant
to be mostly modular, right?

31
00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.599
所以你可以从教训中吸取教训
So that you can kinda skip
from lesson to lesson,

32
00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.680
但你要做的就是在它之间移动
but the way that you have to do
that is moving between git commits.

33
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.150
所以如果我去 github.com/BTholt/complete-intro-to-react-
So if I go to
github.com/BTholt/complete-intro-to-react-

34
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.990
-V5 在课程笔记上也有链接
-V5, there's a link to it as
well in the course notes.

35
00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:14.794
>> Brian Holt: Repo。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Repo.

36
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.110
>> Brian Holt: 雷波在这里，就在这里。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The repo is here,
right there.

37
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.569
所以如果你去了这页然后你向下滚动到它说雷波在这里的地方
So if you go to this page and you scroll
down to where it says the repo is here and

38
00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.009
你点击它就会带你到这里来
you click on that it will take you to
here, which is the repo for the course.

39
00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.000
在这里，您可以单击落实。
And inside of here,
you can click on the commits.

40
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.349
你可以看到这个项目的所有承诺，对。
And you can see all of the commits for
this project, right.

41
00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.750
因此，该课程的每个部分都在一个落实中向前移动。
So each section of this course
moves forward in one commit.

42
00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.229
你可以看到你是否点击了其中一个
So you can see if you
click on one of these,

43
00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.020
你能看出什么是对的吗
you can see what's been added right?

44
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.829
或者如果你点击其中一个，你可以看到这个被删除或者
Or if you click on one of these,
you can see that this got deleted or

45
00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.750
这件事已经更新了
this got updated or something like that.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.920
所以这真的很有助于向你们展示
So this will actually be really helpful
to show you the divs between each part of

47
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.651
当然如果你也要这么做的话
the course if you need to
walk through that as well.

48
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:03.844
>> Brian Holt: 如果要从其中一个开始，实际上可以
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to start in the
middle of one of these, you can actually

49
00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:08.310
就说我想从 useState 和 custom hook 开始，就这样。
just say I want to start with useState and
custom hooks and things like that.

50
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.060
这里有个叫 Sourcetree的节目
There's actually a program
out here called Sourcetree,

51
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.009
我就会建议你得到
that I'm going to suggest that you get.

52
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.930
您可以获取 Sourcetreeapp.com。
You can get the Sourcetreeapp.com.

53
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.050
我已经安装好了
I already have it installed.

54
00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.030
如果你克隆了雷波和点 Sourcetree 的话
And if you clone the repo and
point Sourcetree to it, no,

55
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.259
我为什么要更新这个
why would I update this.

56
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.314
跳过版本。
Skip version.

57
00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:27.340
开个玩笑而已
[LAUGH] Just kidding.

58
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.699
更新所有内容。
Update all of your things.

59
00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.439
但是，你可以在这里看到我在 Sourcetree的这一开放。
But, so you can see here I have
this open here in Sourcetree.

60
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.409
所以如果我想回到这个时代
So if I wanna go back
to this commit in time,

61
00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.039
我可以在这里右键单击并说 " 检出" 。
I can actually just say right-click
on here and say Checkout.

62
00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.829
会说你确定要这么做吗
It's gonna say,
are you sure you want to do this?

63
00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.920
好，首先，这将会消除你所做的任何改变。
Right, so first of all, this will blow
away any changes that you have made.

64
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.240
所以要小心一点对吧
So be be careful of that, right?

65
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.849
但我会说好的
But I'm gonna say okay.

66
00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.319
这会让我回到那个承诺的阶段，对吧 ?
And this will actually move me
back to that commit, right?

67
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.639
所以现在我的 repo 将处于那个状态，我可以继续向前，对吗 ?
So now my repo will be in that state,
and I can keep going forward, right?

68
00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.185
但如果想再向前走
But if wanna move forward again,

69
00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.622
我只能说我想去我们加入 React 路由器的地方
I can just say I wanna go to
where we add React router.

70
00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:02.314
我们也能看到这里的所有潜水夫
We can see all the divs down here as well.

71
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.425
>> Brian Holt: 我可以右键单击并表示检出。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I can just right-click
on this and say checkout.

72
00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:12.044
> > Brian Holt: 现在我就在这里。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now I will be up here.

73
00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:16.826
最后的最后一个承诺就是你有兴趣
And then ultimately the last commit
in here that's you're interested

74
00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:20.579
这一主题的背景就是这一过程的终结。
in is that theme context
that's the end of this course.

75
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.110
这就像现在的主分支的状态。
So that's like the what the state of
the master branch is in right now.

76
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.689
所有这些分支都是为了中间的反应
All of these other branches are for
intermediate React

77
00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.024
你可以在以后再看这个课程
which you can also watch that later
after you're done with this course.

78
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.557
这也很有帮助。
So that's really helpful as well.

79
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.350
>> Brian Holt: 让我们看看。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

80
00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.731
回到这里的页面
Going back to the page here.

81
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.939
你也会看到这些，树枝上的东西。
You'll also see these,
branches things with that.

82
00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:47.699
这些会告诉您在哪里有落实点是正确的。
Those will tell you where
there are commit points right.

83
00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.389
但我很快就会
But I'll be very forthcoming and

84
00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.480
请指出这是您需要前进的承诺。
calling out this is the commit
that you need to go forward.

85
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.247
我会告诉你你想做什么
I'll tell you which commit
message you wanna go forward to.

86
00:04:58.134 --> 00:04:59.423
>> Brian Holt: Sourcetree 真的很棒。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
Sourcetree is really great.

87
00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:02.069
如果您知道如何在命令行上使用 git ，那么也可以使用该命令。

我刚给你看了源树
I just showed you Source Tree,

90
00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.978
因为我觉得这是最容易开始使用的
because I think that's
the easiest one to start using.

91
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:10.711
我还建议了 Git 深度
I'd also suggest Git In-depth,

错误会有拼写错误之类的
mistakes and it's gonna have spelling
errors and things like that.

be super helpful as well.

134
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.350
我只想在这里向 Fronto Masters的船员大喊大叫

the crew here at Frontend Masters.

他们很想和你一起工作

我喜欢他们让我来做这些课程

do these courses and

139

有这些训练并付钱让我去做

140

141
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.370
让我打开源头让所有人都能得到

143
00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:53.689
这就是为什么我花了很多时间
That's why I put a lot
of time into these and

144
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:55.060
所以我觉得我们可以为他们负责
that's why I think we can charge for them.

145
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.990
但我认为这种知识应该自由地分享。

should be freely shared.

最后一件事，如果你想在 GitHub 上启动 repo ，那就好了。
And last thing here, if you wanna start
the repo on GitHub that would be great.

149
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.680
这就是我的自我，那就是重要的部分， [ LAUGH] 只是开玩笑的。
It strokes my ego and that's
the important part, [LAUGH] just kidding.

150
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.834
它确实有助于它得到更远的地方，这也是一件好事。
It does help it get farther reach
which is always a good thing as well.

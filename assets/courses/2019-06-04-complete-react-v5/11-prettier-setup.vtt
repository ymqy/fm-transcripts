00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.819
>> Brian Holt: 现在你可以在这里看到，我没有使用过这个。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now as you can see here,
I haven't been using that.

2
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.064
其实我每次跑都跑得很漂亮
I actually have it runs
prettier every time I run save.

3
00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:09.179
我要教你怎么做
So I'm gonna show you how to do that.

4
00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.859
所以在 VS 代码中，转至 " 扩展" ，
So inside of VS Code,
go to the Extensions,

5
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.089
这里就是这里我有一个叫普雷特的人
which is this one here, and
I have one called prettier.

6
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.960
我确定这上面是最上面的
Which I'm pretty sure
is this top one here.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.260
对这个
Yep, this one.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.789
是有很多下载的那一个
It's the one that has a lot of downloads.

9
00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:37.029
超过 800 万，只需说安装 >> Brian Holt: 好的，
So over eight million and just say install
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

10
00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:42.756
一旦你安装好了我就想让你去你的设置
once you have that installed,
then I want you to go to your Settings.

11
00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:50.420
因此，您可以通过 " 代码首选项设置 " 或 " 命令逗号" 来执行此操作。
So you can either do that through Code
Preferences Settings or Command Comma.

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.563
然后你需要为我做两件事情
And then you need to turn
on two things for me.

13
00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:58.677
您想打开的其中一个是 " 保存时的格式 " 。
One of them you wanna turn
on is Format on Save.

14
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.405
>> Brian Holt: 因此，在 " 保存 " 上使用编辑器格式，请检查该格式，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the editor format on Save, check that one,

15
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:06.900
可能是给你的
that's probably off for you.

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.569
我希望您检查的第二个是配置。
The second one that I want you
to check is require config.

17
00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:17.629
你可以看到我没查过我的
So prettier down here,
you can see, mine's not checked.

18
00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.353
因此， prettier 需要配置。
So prettier, require config.

19
00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:22.200
>> Brian Holt: 请检查该图。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So check that one.

20
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.579
所以你想让漂亮的人跑来
So you want prettier to run but

21
00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.109
你只希望它能在最漂亮的项目上运行，对吗 ?
you only want it to run on projects that
prettier's actually installed on, right?

22
00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.770
你不想再去别的项目有预作了
You don't wanna go on to some other
project and have prettier run on it

23
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.640
因为你要修改每一行代码然后
because then you're going to modify
literally every line of code and then

24
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.549
我要说的是你要把责任推到你身上
the get blame is gonna be on you for every
line of code which is unfun, I will say.

25
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.259
既然我这么做了这个项目还没有配置
So now that I've done that,
this project doesn't have a config yet,

26
00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:49.950
我们还没做过
we haven't made one.

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
所以如果我去做这个，我就在保存它，注意它不固定它。
So if I go and do this, I'm saving it,
and notice that it's not fixing it.

28
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.310
这就是我们现在想要的对吗
That's what we want right now, right?

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.816
我们只希望它能在它有前地的项目上运行。
We only want it to run on
projects where it has prettier.

30
00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.959
接下来我们要做的就是创建一个配置文件。
So the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to create a config file.

31
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.941
因此，创建新文件会将其保存到根
So create a new file save it to the root

32
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:14.084
我和你必须得
directory here adopt me and you have to

33
00:02:14.084 --> 00:02:19.079
将此调用称为 dot.prettierRC。
call this call it dot.prettierRC.

34
00:02:23.384 --> 00:02:25.647
>> Brian Holt: 我甚至不知道 RC 代表什么，但是
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't even
know what RC stands for, but

35
00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:28.245
调用所有 bash 配置文件。
that what all the bash
config files are called.

36
00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:35.531
我们将创建一个名为 ES lint RC， prettier RC， MVM RC， MPM RC。
We're gonna create one called the ES
lint RC, prettier RC, MVM RC, MPM RC.

37
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:36.530
有人知道那代表什么吗
Does anyone know what that stands for?

38
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.479
我也不知道
Me neither.

39
00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.849
好的， prettierRC 制作该文件。
Okay, prettierRC make that file.

40
00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.362
是的我知道这是备用文件这是故意的
Yes I know it's a reserve file,
that's on purpose.

41
00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:52.240
然后我需要你把两个神奇的角色放在这里，空的物体。
And then I need you to put two magical
characters in here, empty objects.

42
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.110
现在有几件事是你可以配置的
Now there are a few things you can
configure about prettier, you know,

43
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.240
如果您想成为选项卡或空间，您是否希望在此处使用空格，或者
if you want to be tabs or spaces,
do you wanted to have spaces here, or

44
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.419
没有空间吗
not have spaces there?

45
00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.120
有几件事
There's a few things.

46
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.530
我告诉过你我不关心我只是想让它工作
I told you, I don't actually care,
I just want it to work.

47
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.949
所以这只是说，给我默认配置。
So this is just saying,
give me the default config.

48
00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:17.957
但如果你想让它在这里有某种形式的配置
But if you want it to have
some sort of config in here,

49
00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:23.022
你可以说 " singleQuote" : false。
you could say, "singleQuote": false.

50
00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:26.800
我只想有双引号或单引号是真的
I only wanna have double quotes or
single quotes, true.

51
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
我只想用单引号对吗
I only wanna have single quotes, right?

52
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860
会有那样的事但是我又不在乎
It'll be things like that,
but, again, I don't care,

53
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.400
所以我要把空的物体放在这里
so I'm just gonna put empty object here.

54
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:40.199
现在，如果我再返回两个 app.js ，我就省了，现在它会真正使用。
So now if I go back over two app.js and
I save, now it'll actually use.

55
00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.932
它会在我每次保存的时候都跑出来，这是我想要的。
It'll run prettier on every single time
that I save which is what I wanted.

56
00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.199
>> Brian Holt: 可以使用 sublime 来完成此操作。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This can
be done with sublime.

57
00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.379
也可以使用其他编辑器来完成此操作。
This can be done with
other editors as well.

58
00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.729
把它从 prettier的网站上读出来
Just read it off of prettier's website.

59
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.764
他们会告诉你怎么做
They'll tell you how to do it.

60
00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:58.822
>> Brian Holt: 有关该问题的问题 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

61
00:03:58.822 --> 00:03:59.719
这是为人民工作吗 ?
Is that working for people?

62
00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.909
太酷了
Cool.

63
00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.133
我还是喜欢这个因为它意味着我就像我大脑中的一部分
Again I love this because it means I get
to shut down like a part of my brain that

64
00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:08.824
思考格式化事物。
thinks about formatting things.

65
00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:12.120
就像你粘贴某样东西的时候
Like typically when you paste something
and it's like, okay well this has to go

66
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.883
我得把这些空间转换成选项卡之类的
here and I have to convert these
spaces to tabs and stuff like that.

67
00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:18.214
你只需闭上你脑中的线就能把重点放在代码上
You just get to shut down that thread
of your brain and focus more on code.

68
00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:22.370
如果您想有一个代码，那么对于 prettier ，不存在非常多的替代方法
There aren't really very many alternatives
for prettier so if you want to have a code

69
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.252
或者如果这是您想要的标准，那么您需要预先设置的格式。
format or if that's something that you
want prettier's by far the standard.

70
00:04:26.252 --> 00:04:32.340
可能有其他的，但要么就是这个要么什么都没有。
There may be others but
it’s either this or nothing.

71
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.471
ESLint 有一个称为修订的东西，您也可以使用该修订。
ESLint has a thing called fix
which you can use that as well but

72
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.829
这也不是一回事
it’s not the same thing.

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.980
>> Brian Holt: 最后我想说的是 dev 工具，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Last thing I wanna
talk about here is dev tools,

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.298
这是绝对必要的
which are absolutely essential.

3
00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:12.191
>> Brian Holt: 因此，我只邀请您去 google React dev 工具和
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I would just invite
you to google React dev tools and

4
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:16.170
然后就放 Chrome 或 Firefox
then just put Chrome or Firefox.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.059
我在火狐上很明显
I'm on Firefox, obviously, so.

6
00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.425
>> Brian Holt: 此处显示 React Dev Tools ，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here it
says React Dev Tools, and

7
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:26.806
我肯定有一个是谷歌 Chrome在那的
I'm sure there's one for,
Google Chrome's right there anyway.

8
00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.746
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特: 所以你来这里说我已经有了，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you just come in
here and you say I already have them,

9
00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:33.929
你就可以在这儿看到他们了对吧
you can see them right up here for
me, right?

10
00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.930
但是 Chrome 也可以，你只需单击它，就可以在 Chrome上安装。
But Chrome as well, you just click that,
and you'll install that on Chrome.

11
00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:44.759
>> Brian Holt: 我认为这是目前唯一存在的两个。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think these
are the only two that exist right now.

12
00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:48.000
边缘没有他们， Safari，我想他们已经摆脱他们了。
Edge doesn't have them, and Safari,
I think they got rid of them.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.539
因此，您必须在 Firefox 或 Chrome 上使用它们。
So you either have to be on Firefox or
Chrome to have them.

14
00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.409
新的边缘将会有它，它是由它来的。
The new Edge will have it,
the Edgium, as it were.

15
00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.500
好，让我给你们演示一下如何使用它。
Okay, and let me show you
a little bit how to use this.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380
这是一个 " 雷法 " 应用程序。
So this is a React application.

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.162
您可以在上面看到它以开发者方式执行 React ，因为它处于红色状态。
You can see up there that it has React
in developer mode because it's in red.

18
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.412
>> Brian Holt: 然后我可以在这里打开我的开发工具，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I can open my dev tools here, and

19
00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:12.689
我有一个新的 " 雷法 " 标签
I have a new React tab right there.

20
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.805
所以我要点击这个， >> Brian Holt: 现在我有了
So I'll click on that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now I have

21
00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:24.019
一个 DOM 探索者，我可以探索一下我是否在探索一个 DOM 树，对吧 ?
a DOM explorer, and I can explore as
if I was exploring a DOM tree, right?

22
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.096
你可以看到那边的斯特里特方式一个应用
So you can see StrictMode there, an app,

23
00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:32.298
然后我就能看到我的搜索参数了
then I can see my searchParams thing and
I can highlight it, right?

24
00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:34.689
它将在页面上显示该组件。
And it will show me that
component on the page.

25
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.829
在里面我可以看到下拉菜单
Inside of that I can see the drop downs.

26
00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.150
我有什么事要做吗
And what's cool is here,
do I have anything passing params around?

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.840
我不知道
I don't really.

28
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.539
但你可以在这里看到，你可以看到这里的一些道具。
But you can see here,
you can see some of the props here.

29
00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.140
我能看到它所拥有的所有孩子
I can see all the children that it has,
it's

30
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.509
用于 React 应用程序的有用的 DOM 资源管理器，对吗 ?
a useful kind of DOM explorer for
a React application, right?

31
00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.140
说我有个大应用程序要找滴，所以
Let's say I have a big application
I need to find drop down, so

32
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.189
我就能在这里输入
I can just type in here, drop down,

33
00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.099
它也会在那里搜寻，这也很有用。
and it'll actually search for
drop down there, which is useful as well.

34
00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:12.819
我可以在这里点击这件事，我可以弄清楚这件事是从哪里来的，
I can click this thing right here, and I
can figure out where this is coming from,

35
00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.360
这样我就能找到这个输入然后点击这个
so I can find this input and
click on that.

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.310
就像，好吧，这是你要找的输入。
And it's like, okay,
this is the input you're looking for.

37
00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.199
我能看到它所得到的属性改变处理程序
I can see the properties that
it's getting, the change handler,

38
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.289
占位符值等等。
the placeholder value,
and so on and so forth.

39
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.460
你可以做点别的事让我们说我只是在页面上
Something else cool you can do,
let's say I'm just on the page here and

40
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.539
我要在这里找到这个 " 提交 " 按钮。
I want to find this
Submit button right here.

41
00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.229
所以你可以右键单击它
So you can right-click on it,

42
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.634
表示 " 检查元素" ，就像通常那样，对吗 ?
say Inspect Element,
just like you normally would, right?

43
00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:42.930
这会带你去探长
This will take you to the inspector, but

44
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.329
如果我点击 React dev 工具，还会突出显示，对吧 ?
if I click on the React dev tools,
it will still be highlighted, right?

45
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.740
还有最后一件事我可以进入控制台
And then last thing here,
I can actually go into the console, and

46
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.189
如果我想搞砸我就能把它放了
if I wanna mess around with it,
I can put $R, and

47
00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.229
在 React dev 工具中选择的任何内容都将在我的控制台中为 $R 。
whatever is selected in the React dev
tools will be $R inside of my console.

48
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.503
因此，我也可以通过编程方式来处理它。
So I can programmatically
manipulate it there as well.

49
00:03:12.048 --> 00:03:12.894
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And just so you know,

50
00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:15.240
你也可以跟巡官那样做
you can actually do that
with the inspector as well.

51
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.518
所以如果我点击那我就放了零
So if I click on that and I put $0,

52
00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:24.560
你也可以和普通的探长一样
you can do that with just
the normal inspector as well.

53
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.402
我认为你可以做 1 美元，这可能只是一个 Chrome 的事情，但是
And I think you can do $1,
that might be a Chrome-only thing, but

54
00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:31.870
就能抓住你之前抓住的东西对吧
that'll grab the previous thing
that you have grabbed, right?

55
00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.810
因此， dev 工具非常有助于执行 React 应用程序，
So the dev tools are very very
helpful in doing React applications,

56
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.030
一些你想确定的东西
something you wanna have installed for
sure.

57
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.283
>> 扬声器 2: 如果我们投票的是站点的生产版本，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we're voting
the production version of the site,

58
00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:50.438
当我单击工具的图标时，会收到警告，
I get a warning when I click
on the icon for the tools,

59
00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:56.224
警告说我们用的是生产带或发展带
warning that we're using the production
belt or the development belt.

60
00:03:56.224 --> 00:04:00.340
是 " 雷法" 工具或开发带的发展带吗 ?
Is that the development belt of
the tools or development belt of React?

61
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.237
>> Brian Holt: 你在哪里看到的?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where are you seeing that?

62
00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:07.759
>> 演讲者 2: 在您的扩展中，单击该内容。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In your extensions,
clicking on that.

63
00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.990
>> Brian Holt: 对，是什么 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so what's it?

64
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.471
如果我去 Netflix.com ， > Brian Holt: 这
If I go to Netflix.com,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

65
00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:23.737
主页是使用 React 的生产构建构建的，对吗 ?
homepage is built using
the production build of React, right?

66
00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:26.269
所以这只是让你知道
So it's just letting you know hey,

67
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:29.209
您处于开发方式，不应将其装运到生产环境。
you're in development mode, you should
not be shipping this to production.

68
00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:31.610
在你的发展中环境下就可以了
It's okay to have in your developing
environment, as you should,

69
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.699
但这是你进入生产时应该看到的
but this is what you should see
when you go into production.

70
00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:39.409
>> 扬声器 2: 不是 Parcel 转 iling 和 munifying 什么的，然后是什么
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Isn't Parcel transpiling and
munifying everything, and then what

71
00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.790
我们在这里呈现，我们打开的是生产版本还是不?
we're rendering here, what we have
opened is the production version or no?

72
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.403
>> Brian Holt: 仍然是开发版本，这是您想要的，对吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's still the development
version, which is what you want, right?

73
00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:51.100
库兹如果我没有开发环境
Cuz if I didn't have
the development environment,

74
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.430
那我就不会得到 React 给你的有用的错误信息了
then I wouldn't get all the useful
error messages that React has for you.

75
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.911
就说错了，祝你好运，对吧 ?
It would just say an error happened,
and good luck, right?

76
00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:02.480
>> Brian Holt: 不是这样说的。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Instead of saying
this broke at this line in this way.

77
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.288
>> 演讲者 2: 好的，谢谢。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

78
00:05:03.288 --> 00:05:07.519
所以即使我们把它从 dist 文件夹中跑出来，也不是生产。
So even though we're running it out of
the dist folder, it's not production.

79
00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.069
>> Brian Holt: 对。 >> 演讲者 2: 好的。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

80
00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:12.360
>> Brian Holt: 是的，我将向您演示如何在稍后构建该产品。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I'll show you
how to build it for production later.

81
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.860
>> 演讲者 2: 谢谢。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thanks.

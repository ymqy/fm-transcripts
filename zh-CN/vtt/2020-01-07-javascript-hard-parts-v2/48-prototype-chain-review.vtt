00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.209
威尔 · 森塔斯: 所以，把解决方案二总结回到这个目标的核心。
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So to summarize solution
two back to the core of the goal here.

2
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.384
就像我给我们所有人的奖励，只是，有趣的事情。
Like I gave those bonus pieces there for
all of us just, intriguing things.

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.339
使用原型链，使用 JavaScript prototype 或
Using the prototype chain,
using JavaScript prototype or

4
00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.059
用户一号和用户二号,
feature that user one and user two,

5
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:24.239
从它们在用户创建器内部创建时开始访问
go access from when they were
created inside of user creator

6
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.679
创建的顺序给了他们的对象一个使用函数存储的键。
with the order to create which gave their
object a bond to use a function store.

7
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.347
当我运行用户 one.increment 并且没有找到它时,
When I ran user one.increment and
did not find it,

8
00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:35.060
用户1的增量功能，我慌了吗？
the increment functionality of user one,
did I panic?

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.140
没有，我在原型链上向用户提供了原型参考
No, I headed up the proto reference
at the prototype chain to the user

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.811
函数存储在哪里我找到了增量，我运行它，问题与这？
function store where I found increment,
and I run it, problems with this?

11
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.649
没问题，很漂亮。
No problems, it's beautiful.

12
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.049
这有点像《星球大战》 ，你在面试中对面试官说:
It's a sort of Star Wars with you in
your interview said to your interviewer,

13
00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:57.350
我更喜欢这样，因为我想对我的文章进行更细致的控制
I prefer because I want more fine
grained control over my writing of my

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.159
我倾向于尝试和遵循这种方法。
oxygen that I tend to try and
follow this approach.

15
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.680
他们会去，他们会想最坏的情况。
And they're gonna go,
they're gonna think the worst.

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.219
但是，同时，他们会去，令人印象深刻。
But, at the same time,
they're gonna go, impressive.

17
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.480
我最好说我同意。
I better say I agree.

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.405
他们会说，是的，我也是，是的。
They're gonna go, yes, me too, yes.

19
00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:22.379
他们不是说这是正确的方式，这当然不是标准。
They're not saying is the right way,
it's certainly not standard.

20
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.569
我不是建议你用这个，但是
And I would not be
suggesting you use this but

21
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.599
这将会成为真正发生事情的答案
it's gonna turn out to be the answer
to what's really happening

22
00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.789
当我们用标准的方法达到同样的目标时。
when we do use the standard way
of achieving this same goal.

23
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.609
因为标准的方式，解决方案三，解决方案四，越来越公正的解决方案四,
Cuz the standard way, solution three and
four, increasingly just solution four,

24
00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.979
在幕后操纵这一切。
behind the scenes is doing all this here.

25
00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.680
这意味着如果你要调试，你必须理解它。
And that means if you've gotta debug,
you've gotta understand it.

26
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.859
这意味着，如果你想采访和回答问题，什么是新的关键字
That means if you wanna interview and
answer the question what's the new keyword

27
00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.859
真正的幕后工作，你得知道所有这些东西。
actually doing behind the scenes,
you got to know all this stuff.

28
00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.629
我要说的是如果你在写作,
And I will say this, if you're writing,

29
00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.109
如果你用这种思维方式来思考,
if once you start thinking in this
paradigm in this way of thinking,

30
00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.519
你开始组织你所做的一切，作为对象包含
you start structuring everything
you do as object containing

31
00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:06.319
与该功能及其相关功能相关的数据。
the data that's pertinent to that feature
and its associated functionality.

32
00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.789
你解决的问题有用户、管理员、版主和测验问题,
You solving have users and admins,
and moderators, and quiz questions,

33
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.969
还有排名表，甚至游戏应用程序本身。
and league tables, and
even the game application itself.

34
00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.199
一切都只是与之相关的数据的集合，但是
All is just a collection of
data associated with that but

35
00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.889
甚至是棋盘,
even the game board,

36
00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.620
游戏板的尺寸，然后与游戏板相关的功能。
the dimensions of the game board and then
functionality related to that game board.

37
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.670
我用这种方式处理所有的事情。
I use something for
everything in this way.

38
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.479
所以你开始写很多这样的函数来产生一个对象,
So you start writing a lot of these
functions that produce an object,

39
00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.650
有时一个对象只有一个函数
sometimes just one object with
just a sort of functions and

40
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.789
你以前只有一个，从现在开始你就这么想吧。
you only ever have one of them,
you just think in this manner from now on.

41
00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.430
所以我想如果你总是在里面创造一个小物体，总是让你的
So I guess if you're always creating
a little object inside, always making your

42
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.920
连接到一个函数存储，总是返回那个对象，我猜
connection to a store of functions, always
returning that object out like, I guess it

43
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.699
也许每次在这个过程中都能有办法拯救自己会更好。
might be nice to have a way of saving
yourself during that process every time.

44
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.939
但这种方式是超级复杂的，但它不是标准的。
But it is super sophisticated this way,
but it isn't standard.

45
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:57.789
所以我们现在要看到，在解决方案三，更标准的方式
So we're now gonna see in solution
three the more standard way

46
00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:03.120
介绍一下关键词，他们是所有的努力工作，它的新。
introducing the keyword, they're all
that makes the hard work, its new.

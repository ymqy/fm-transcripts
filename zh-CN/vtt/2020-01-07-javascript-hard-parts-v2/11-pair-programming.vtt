00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.149
威尔 · 森坦斯: 让我们进入结对编程的人们,
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Let's go
into Pair Programming folks,

2
00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.400
我们会先遇到这些东西
we're gonna start encountering
these things first, and

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.730
然后，事后，实际解决它们，看看它们是如何工作的。
then, afterwards, actually resolving
them and seeing how they work.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.400
所以你会首先看到高阶函数
So you're gonna start seeing
high order functions first, and

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.570
然后我们自己解决。
then we're gonna start actually
resolving them ourselves.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.760
所以，我们要使用结对编程来做到这一点，这是迄今为止和
So, we're gonna use Pair Programming
to do so, this is by far and

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.429
作为一个工程师，最有效的成长方式。
away the most effective way
to grow as an engineer.

8
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.170
如果你以前做过，你可能已经知道这一点，但是
If you've done it before,
you probably already know this, but

9
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.070
我们要用一种非常有效的方法。
we're going to do it in
a really effective way here.

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.109
看看这个，如果你想把自己打造成一个工程师,
Take a look at this, if you
are building yourself as an engineer,

11
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.750
你经常会陷入两个非常危险的陷阱。
you fall into often two very risky traps.

12
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.229
一个是研究者，一个是堆叠叠花，两者都是
One is the researcher and
one is the Stack Overflower, both

13
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.356
正在逃避成为一名工程师的真正意义，我马上就会告诉你们。
are avoiding what it really is to be an
engineer, which I'll tell you in a second.

14
00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:44.380
研究人员避免成为一名工程师,
The researcher avoids what
it is to be an engineer,

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.600
就是能够击中整个街区并以某种方式解决它,
which is to be able to hit a whole
block and somehow resolve through it,

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.619
这就是作为一个工程师的全部，我们到底要怎么做呢？
that is all it is to be an engineer,
how do we actually do that?

17
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.179
我早该想到的我们应该这么做,
I should have figured out,
here's how we do it,

18
00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.863
这是我们如何实际解决打击整个街区，我们通过代码。
here's how we actually resolve hitting
a whole block we go through the code.

19
00:00:59.863 --> 00:01:04.250
当我们在那个一行一行地阻塞我们并且理解数据的位上时，他们
When we on that bit that's blocking us
line by line and understand the data, they

20
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.609
我们称之为状态，当你一行一行地查看活动数据时，这就是调试。
call it the state, the live data as you go
through line by line, that is debugging.

21
00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.664
它会命中一个块并假设代码，然后进行控制台日志记录
It's hitting a block and assuming
the code, and then console logging

22
00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:19.769
使用其他调试工具，一行一行地查看数据。
essential using some other debugging tool,
the data as you go through, line by line.

23
00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:22.140
虽然我们喜欢避免这样做,
We love to avoid doing that though,

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
我们会不惜一切代价避免这个过程，我们会养成这样的习惯
we will do anything to avoid doing that
process, we gonna get in that habit of

25
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.430
我们会尽一切努力，包括这里的一两件事。
doing so we'll do anything we can,
including one or two these things here.

26
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.150
我们成为了研究者，那个障碍，我们看到了神秘的一面,
We become the researcher, that block,
we look at the mystery bit,

27
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.799
也许是个新的关键词。
maybe it's a new key word.

28
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.120
在接下来的三天里，我们阅读了所有关于
And we spend the following three
days reading every last thing about

29
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.189
新的关键词，以及原型链的所有方面，非常棒。
the new keyword, and about all aspects
of the prototype chain, and wonderful.

30
00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.694
然而，我们不写一行代码，我们避免了块,
And yet we don't write a single
line of code, we avoid the block,

31
00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:54.918
另一种方法是从 Stack Overflow 获取代码片段来修复 bug。
the other approach is to grab snippets of
code to fix a bug from Stack Overflow.

32
00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:57.216
当我们插上电源不能工作时,
And when that one when we plug it in,
doesn't work,

33
00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.319
把这段加上我们加进去的部分。
take that snippet plus the bit we added.

34
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.510
把它放到 Stack Overflow 中，然后说，这些位是如何粘在一起的？
Put it in the Stack Overflow, and say,
how do these bits, stick together?

35
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.550
两者都不是有效的，都是作为一个工程师所必需的,
Neither is effective in its own isolation,
both are necessary to being an engineer,

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.469
你们在职业生涯的第一年就这么做了，这两个都是。
you've done this in the first year
of your careers, both of these.

37
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.254
可能是这样的，是的，就是这样的，但是你必须要做得更好
That's probably, yeah, that's how it is,
but you've gotta get better at

38
00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:18.114
平衡这两者，以及最重要的部分。
balancing those two and the really
important bit which is just going through.

39
00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:22.385
并在控制台日志的帮助下逐行分析代码
And analyzing the code yourself line by
line by line with the help of console logs

40
00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:24.697
或者调试工具的帮助。
or the help of some
sort of debugging tool.

41
00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:26.329
然后，是的，去理解和
And then yes, going to understand and

42
00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.759
建立你的基本原则，理解这就是研究者。
building your underlying principles
understanding that's the researcher.

43
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.490
但是有时候你会说，我不知道它是怎么工作的,
And yet taking snippets that sometimes
you just go, I don't know how it works,

44
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.276
是魔法，但它的工作，这是一个工程师的一部分，但
is magic but it works,
that’s part of being an engineer but

45
00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:38.469
你得保持平衡。
you gotta get that balance right.

46
00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.689
这样做的途径是结对编程,
And the route to do so
is Pair Programming,

47
00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.699
你可以解决困难的问题，还有个同伙和你一起犯罪。
you get to tackle tough blocks and
you got a partner in crime alongside you.

48
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:50.900
你必须专注于手头的问题，因为你不能逃避。
You get to stay focused on the problem
at hand because you can’t run away.

49
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.360
去泡一杯茶因为他们就坐在你旁边,
To make a cup of tea, because they're
literally sitting there right beside you,

50
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.750
你也不能花太多时间做这些事。
and you also can't spend too
much time doing these things.

51
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.870
所以研究人员,
So the researcher,

52
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.620
我仍然记得我第一次和一个叫约翰的人进行结对编程。
I still remember my first time pair
programming with a guy called John.

53
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.753
他坐在我旁边
And he sits next to me, and

54
00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:04.860
他说，你不介意我们先研究一下这个吧。
he's like, do you mind if we do some
sort of reading up on this first.

55
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.128
我说当然然然后大概8分钟他说,
And I said of course, and
then like eight minutes he then says,

56
00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:09.793
你介意我开始吗
do you mind if I get started, and

57
00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:14.213
我想要读完每一本书，我想先全部理解，对吗？
I was like I wanted to read up on every,
I wanna understand it all first, right?

58
00:03:14.213 --> 00:03:16.409
我做不到，我的搭档在等我
I couldn't, my partner was waiting for

59
00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.079
我他们准备运行，我也不能只是给他们一个代码片段。
me they were ready to run, I also
couldn't just give them a code snippet.

60
00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.278
我记得有一次我在处理纸张，有一个叫爱丽丝的人
I remember a time I was working with
paper and someone called Alice and

61
00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:26.276
我不能只给他们一个代码片段。
I couldn't just give them a code snippet.

62
00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:29.336
因为他们不告诉我为什么要用这个,
Because they were like, won't talk
me through why we're using this,

63
00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:30.719
它是如何解决问题的。
how it's solving the problem.

64
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.430
当我们结对编程来表达和解释我们的代码时，我们就是傻瓜
We are fools when we pair programming
to verbalize and explain our code and

65
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.310
因此，不仅使它单独工作的一些元素，但
therefore not just make it work
alone some element of that but

66
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.139
理解我们所做的。
understanding as we go.

67
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.400
这是另一个重要的部分，它将改进我们的技术沟通,
And that's the other big piece here, it's
gonna refine our technical communication,

68
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.389
我们的配对程序是这样的。
the way we pair program is this.

69
00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.887
如果我是导航员，我会看提示符，然后
If I'm navigator,
I'm looking at the prompt and

70
00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:56.400
我看到它说，我让 twitteapi 变得很酷。
I'm seeing it says,
I make it cool to Twitte API.

71
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.219
我现在要带领我的伴侣，他们的手放在键盘上打字
I'm now going to lead my partner their
hands are on the keyboard typing and

72
00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.907
实际上执行代码本身
actually executing the code itself and

73
00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:07.032
然后口头解释一个策略，他们必须变成实际的代码。
then verbally explain a strategy that
they must turn into actual code.

74
00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:11.590
他们不能下车，他们不能做到他们的方式，他们必须采取我的解释和
They can't get off, they can't do it their
way they have to take my explanation and

75
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.759
如果他们不理解我的解释,
implement it and if they're not
understanding my explanation,

76
00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.050
这都是我的功劳。
that's all in me.

77
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.980
我不能说，嘿，实际上，让我告诉你怎么做,
I can't say, hey, actually,
let me just show you how to do it,

78
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.240
我必须能够如此清晰地表达出来
I've got to be able to
verbalize with such clarity and

79
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.629
精确的直观风格，我的搭档可以把它变成真正的代码。
precision intuitive style, that my partner
can actually turn it into real code.

80
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.889
这真是了不起，它将使我的技术沟通达到无法估量的程度。
That is remarkable, it's gonna refine my
technical communication beyond measure.

81
00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.310
为什么结对编程如此重要,
Why pair programming is so important as
a team doing these industry reviews with,

82
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.040
你知道的，工程经理和工业界的人来教我们的课程。
you know, engineering managers and
folks in industry for our curriculum.

83
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.600
这个新课程让我们这么做，但是
This new curriculum is
what makes us do it, but

84
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.290
不管他们让我们复习新课程,
whatever they make us
review the new curriculum,

85
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.949
因为和我们合作的是政府机构。
because it's government agency
that we're doing it with.

86
00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.329
就是这样，听到他们的声音真让人吃惊
So there you go,
it's astonishing to hear them

87
00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:57.560
谈论他们的高级工程师，他们可能会感到沮丧。
talk about their senior engineers
that they are may be frustrated with.

88
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.990
谁不能用语言表达他们的代码，这是一个巨大的障碍，一个公司。
Who cannot verbalize their code well,
that is a massive hindrance to a company.

89
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.290
所以即使你经验丰富,
So even if you're very seasoned,

90
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.240
这是一个很好的机会，可以有效地表达你的代码。
this is a huge opportunity to
verbalize your code effectively.

91
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.029
所以就这样，就像我说的，你要接受挑战，一个提示，然后
So there we go, as I say, you're
gonna take a challenge, a prompt, and

92
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.069
其中之一就是领航员。
one of this'll mean navigator.

93
00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.170
我要口头解释一个策略口头上的伪代码,
I'm gonna be explaining a strategy
verbally, verbal pseudocode,

94
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.589
所以对于一个要用实际代码执行的合伙人来说。
so to speak to a partner who's gonna
be executing it in actual code.

95
00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.720
好的，你要这样做，你知道，5分钟的领航员,
Okay, you're going to do it for,
you know, five minutes navigator,

96
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.009
五分钟，司机和女巫结束。
five minutes driver and witch over.

97
00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.959
顺便说一句如果你认为你的伴侣走错路了,
If you do think by the way,
your partner's going off on a bad route,

98
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.920
不要阻止他们，不要说我认为那不会起作用。
don't block them,
don't say I think that's not gonna work.

99
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.430
让它发生吧按 Run 你会看到 bug 不是错误,
Let it happen, press Run,
you're gonna see a bug is not a mistake,

100
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.879
你现在知道这个窃听器，可以用来识别问题所在。
the bug is something that you now know can
be used to identify what the problem was.

101
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:40.625
太棒了,
That's awesome,

102
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:43.468
你可以成为一个调试器，在那里你已经知道什么是坏的。
you get to be a debugger with them
where you already know what's broken.

103
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.810
还有一些奇怪的错误就像你知道的记号什么的,
And something that weird error that's
like, you know, token whatever,

104
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.040
这不是什么秘密。
now, it's not a mystery.

105
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.000
这是你可以做到的,
It's something you actually can, you know,

106
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.879
幕后的东西是错误的，这实际上是很好的。
what's behind the scene's wrong,
that's pretty nice actually.

107
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.088
好吧顺便说一句有一半的时间是对的
Okay, and by the way,
half the time that may be right and

108
00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.023
根据策略，我们走吧，伙计们。
according to the strategy,
there we go people.

109
00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.098
我们要结对编程，我们要用旧的风格，我们要去
We're going to pair program and we are
going to do the old style and we're going

110
00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:05.129
通过这个九件事的列表，你们看到了。
to go through this list of nine things,
have reached thing that you see here.

111
00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.615
给自己一个积分，总分在1到9之间,
Give yourself a point to get
a total of between one and nine,

112
00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:13.024
是的如果你以前都做过,
yes, so
if you've done all of these before,

113
00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:18.165
这些你都考虑过了，你的总分是，九分。
you've covered all of these,
your score is, total out of, nine.

114
00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:21.391
我不知道这是怎么被切断的，总共9个，如果你做了所有这些,
I don't know how that got cut off, a total
out of nine, if you've done all of these,

115
00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:22.492
你得了9分。
you've got a score of nine.

116
00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:25.843
如果你按顺序做了三个，得分是三，按顺序做了五个,
If you've done three of them in any order,
score of three, five of them in any order,

117
00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.060
五分。
score of five.

118
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.660
好的，一旦你知道了你的记录,
Okay, once you know your tally,

119
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.680
各位，我们又回到了老式的哈利波特风格。
people, we are back to the old
school Harry Potter style.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.674
>> Brian Holt: 所以说，嘿，我需要一个钥匙，所以
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's saying,
hey, I need a key, so

2
00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:08.948
让我们再谈这事
let's talk about that for just a second.

3
00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:12.900
那么，在重新呈现这一过程中， " 反应 " 如何呢 ?
So how does React work in
terms of like rerendering it?

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.873
每当发生更改时，它会在此处运行 reender 函数，对吗 ?
Everytime that something changes,
it runs the rerender function here, right?

5
00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:23.766
因此，它再次运行此 searchParams 函数。
So it runs this searchParams
function again.

6
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.768
我想让你想象这些选择可能更加复杂。
I want you to imagine that maybe
these options were more complicated.

7
00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:31.640
也许他们对 DOM 结构的内缩有很深的影响
Maybe they were deeply of
necetries of DOM structures, so

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.386
让我们说我有能力用这种方式来选择
let's say I had the ability to resort
these options one way or another.

9
00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.796
雷act通常会看到的是
Well, what React would typically see is,

10
00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:45.590
这跟以前不一样了我要把所有东西都重新呈现
this is different than it was before,
I'm gonna go rerender everything.

11
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.634
但如果我只是用不同的顺序
But if I'm just resorting
them into a different order,

12
00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:52.344
这将是一个非常必要的工作，相当缓慢，很可能。
that would be a lot of a necessary work,
quite slow, potentially.

13
00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:57.567
什么是有用的，比如，嘿， React，我刚刚重新订了这些。
What would be really useful, is like,
hey, React, I just reordered these.

14
00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:58.987
我没有创造和
I didn't actually create and

15
00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:01.898
毁了一切他们现在的顺序就不同了
destroy anything,
they're just in a different order now.

16
00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:04.810
你能做到这一点你可以说
And the way you can do
that is you can say,

17
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.683
key = 关于该特定项的一些唯一的东西。
key = some unique thing
about that particular item.

18
00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:11.278
在这种情况下，它们都是字符串，我知道它们都不同。
In this case they're all strings and
I know they're all different.

19
00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:15.385
所以如果我说键 = [动物] 那就开心了，
So if I say key =
[animal] then it's happy,

20
00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:20.871
因为它说如果狗在这里但现在它在下面
because then it says if dog was here,
but now it's down here.

21
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.936
就像我要选择那样我才不会毁了它
It's like I'm just going to take that
option, I'm not gonna destroy it,

22
00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:26.337
我要把它移到下面这才是关键
I'm just gonna move it down there,
so that's what key does.

23
00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:30.539
所以这是一个非常容易做到的表演。
So it's a little performance
thing that's really easy to do.

24
00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.438
所以这里的关键是，它应该是一个独特的标识符，
So the key here is, it needs to be some
sort of unique identifier about that

25
00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:36.905
特定对象，对吗 ?
particular object, right?

26
00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:40.748
因此，如果您正在对用户对象进行排序，那么可以通过电子邮件对其进行排序，或者
So maybe if you're sorting user objects,
you can sort it by the email, or

27
00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:44.045
他们的用户身份或者每个用户都是唯一的
their user ID, or
something that's gonna be unique per user.

28
00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.546
然后，如果它在这里移动，然后在这里移动，它是一样的。
Then if it moves here, and then it
moves down here, it is the same thing.

29
00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:53.317
所以， React 可以告诉它是一回事，有道理吗 ?
So that React can tell it's
the same thing, makes sense?

30
00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:58.959
现在重要的是它必须是唯一的，所以如果我放了 1 个，对吧 ?
Now something that's really important is
it has to be unique, so if I put 1, right?

31
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.472
现在所有这些都要有 1 个钥匙而且要疯了
Now all of these are gonna have a key
of 1 and is going to freak out.

32
00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:09.032
>> Brian Holt: 它会说，嘿，我遇到的是同一个键 1。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna say, hey,
I encountered with the same key 1.

33
00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:13.546
这对我来说没道理所以如果你这样做会很奇怪的
That doesn't make any sense to me, so
it'll do weird things if you do that.

34
00:02:16.914 --> 00:02:19.141
>> Brian Holt: 在这种情况下，它实际上是在渲染它们，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In this case, it actually
is rendering them, so good for that,

35
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:20.649
但有时它不会让它们发生
but sometimes it just won't render them.

36
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.599
所以，确保它实际上是独一无二的。
So make sure it is actually
unique about them.

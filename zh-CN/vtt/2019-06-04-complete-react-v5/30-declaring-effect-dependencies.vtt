00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.659
>> Brian: 越来越近。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Getting closer.

2
00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:05.299
我们有一个问题， setBreed 没有定义。
We have one problem here,
that setBreed's not defined.

3
00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.419
所以我们要做的是如果你还记得的话
So what we're gonna do is,
if you remember, we did pass that here and

4
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:12.060
在末尾使用下拉项， setState 函数，对吗 ?
use drop down at the end,
the setState function, right?

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.539
所以我们也要把它抓了
So we're just gonna grab that too.

6
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.562
那么 setBreed ，现在就可以定义了，对，
So setBreed, and
now that'll be defined, right,

7
00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:22.750
从使用的下降到现在
cuz that's coming from the use drop down.

8
00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:30.065
>> Brian: 尚未使用品种，没关系，但是
&gt;&gt; Brian: Not using breed yet,
that's okay, but

9
00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:34.348
我们现在要做的事就是你知道
the thing that we're getting here is hey,
just so you know,

10
00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:39.070
它包含对 setBreeds 的调用，但没有依赖关系列表。
it contains a call to to setBreeds
without a list of dependencies.

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.329
这可能导致无限的更新链。
This can lead to an infinite
chain of updates.

12
00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.735
所以这里的问题是用 " useEffect " 来声明你的附属关系
So the problem here is with useEffect,
you have to declare your dependencies,

13
00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:49.831
这有点奇怪但只和我待过一段时间
which is kind of an odd phrasing this,
but stick with me for just a second.

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.597
>> Brian:useEffect 将立即运行，
&gt;&gt; Brian: useEffect is going to run,
as of right now,

15
00:00:57.597 --> 00:01:02.270
每次被人打电话的时候都很频繁对吧
after every single time that render gets
called, which is too frequently, right?

16
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.019
那就现在
So right now,

17
00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:10.920
每次我把它输入到这里它就会要求一套新的品种
every time I typed into location here,
it would request a new set of breeds.

18
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.620
这显然不正确不是我们想做的对吗
That's obviously incorrect,
it's not what we wanna do, right?

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.858
我们只想要在动物更新和第一次更新时请求品种。
We only wanna request breeds when animal
updates, as well as on the first time.

20
00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.951
> > 布莱恩: 你可以用 useEffect 来做什么
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
what you can do here with useEffect,

21
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:27.221
>> 布莱恩: 不如这样
&gt;&gt; Brian: Rather than have this

22
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:31.579
在每次呈现后运行，我们只能说在这些事情发生变化时才会运行。
run after every single render, we can
say only run when these things change.

23
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.200
所以你要做的就是宣布它所依赖的东西。
So what you do is you declare
the things that it depends on.

24
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.840
所以这要看什么
So here it depends on what?

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.460
看动物吧
It depends on animal, right?

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.120
如果这些改变，那么我们就需要改变它。
Cuz if that changes then
we need to change it.

27
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.819
所以我们会把动物放在那里， >> 布莱恩: 但是
So we'll put animal there,
&gt;&gt; Brian: But

28
00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.770
它在技术上也取决于 setBreed 和 setBreeds。
it also technically depends
on setBreed and setBreeds.

29
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.679
现在你和我都知道这永远不会改变
Now, you and I both know that
that's never gonna change,

30
00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.212
但是， >> Brian: ESLint 要求它们仍然
but,
&gt;&gt; Brian: ESLint demands that they still

31
00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:01.650
因为它仍然在技术上取决于它们
be there because it still
technically depends on them.

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.680
所以 setBreeds 也一样
So setBreeds as well.

33
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.901
> > 布莱恩: 这些都是什么顺序的，
&gt;&gt; Brian: It doesn't matter
what order these come in,

34
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.229
它只是 React 要检查的依赖关系的列表。
it's just a list of dependencies
that React will check.

35
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:15.581
如果更改了其中任何一个，请将其重新运行，然后重新运行此效果，
Cuz if any one of these things changed,
rerun this effect after it renders,

36
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:18.033
否则不要再运行了吧
otherwise, don't run it again, right?

37
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.973
那么现在如果位置发生变化，因为位置不在这里，
So now if location changes,
because location's not in here,

38
00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:22.645
它不会重新运行这种效应
it's not gonna rerun this effect.

39
00:02:26.302 --> 00:02:30.949
> > 布莱恩: 那么让我们来确保这实际上是有用的。
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
let's go make sure this actually works.

40
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.807
如果我刷新这个， >> Brian: 现在，
If I refresh this,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Now,

41
00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:38.659
请注意这一品种已不再灰显
notice that breed is no longer grayed out.

42
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.789
如果我点击这里
If I click on here,

43
00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:44.930
你可以看到它其实有很多新的狗，对吧 ?
you can see that it actually has
a lot of new dogs in it, right?

44
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.110
请注意，如果我开始在此处输入，它不会请求新的品种。
And notice that if I start typing in
here it doesn't request new breeds.

45
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.831
但是如果我把狗换为猫
However, if I changed the dog to be cat,

46
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.605
注意它会在这里灰暗一点
notice that it's gonna gray out here for
just a second.

47
00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:06.143
> > 布莱恩: 速度非常快，但现在注意到它有美国的粗线，
&gt;&gt; Brian: That was very fast, but now
notice here that it has American bobtail,

48
00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:10.050
Calico和 Cornish Rex 之类的
and Calico, and Cornish Rex,
and things like that.

49
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.159
跟小毛茸毛的一样
Same thing with small furry.

50
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.302
我想你可以收养一个小人
I guess you can adopt a skunk.

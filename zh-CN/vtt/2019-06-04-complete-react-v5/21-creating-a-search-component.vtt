00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.580
>> Brian Holt: Hoks 是 React 的真正新功能。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hooks is
a really new feature to React.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.019
如果你在你听说过的泰维特斯球上
It's probably something that if you're
on the Twitterspheres that you've heard

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.639
啊，对吧 ?
of, right?

4
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.425
这可能是在 11 月，当他们宣布的时候。
And this got introduced maybe about,
November is when they announced it.

5
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:12.365
它已经被卷走了
And it's been rolling out.

6
00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:15.762
因此，它现在一般都可以作为第 16.8 号法案使用。
And so now it's generally
available as of React 16.8.

7
00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:19.995
所以我现在要告诉你的第一件事是，这完全是选择性的。
So the first thing I'm gonna tell you
right now is, that's totally optional.

8
00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.640
你现在不用胡克丝了
You do not have to use Hooks right now.

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.420
但是我要先给你教给他们，
But I am going to teach them to you first,

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.129
因为我觉得他们是想写 React 组件的更容易的方法
because I think they're an easier way to
think about writing React components.

11
00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.292
然后我们也要去另一种语法，就是类语法，
And then we're also going to the other
syntax as well which is class syntax,

12
00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:35.518
你得知道这俩人的事好吗
cuz you need to know both of them, okay?

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.192
>> Brian Holt: 对于观看视频的人，如果您正在观看
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For those of you that
are watching the video, if you're watching

14
00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:47.109
这只是为了学胡克丝这里有一个叫 Hook in Depth的章节
this just to learn Hooks, there is
a section here called Hooks in Depth.

15
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.732
这也许是个跳跳跳伞的好东西对吧
It's probably a good sport to jump in,
right?

16
00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:52.085
因为那部分完全孤立于其他的
Because that section is totally
isolated from the other ones and

17
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.649
它会穿过所有钩子
it goes over all of the hooks.

18
00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.060
>> 扬声器 2: 将在中间重定向课程中。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That will be in
the Intermediate React course.

19
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.719
>> Brian Holt: 是，将在中间 React 课程中。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, that will be
in the Intermediate React course.

20
00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.347
我认为这是 " 中级反应 " 课程的第一部分。
I think it is the first section
of the Intermediate React course.

21
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:08.400
> > Brian Holt: 好的，但你也可以从这里开始。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, but
you could also start from here as well.

22
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.926
所以，让我们来谈谈钩子会为我们做些什么。
So, let's talk about what hooks do for us.

23
00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:21.670
>> Brian Holt: 让我们回到我们的代码，让我们在这里做一个新的组件。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go back to our
code, let's make a new component here.

24
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.606
我们会叫它 SearchParams.js
And we're gonna call it SearchParams.js.

25
00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.319
也会在源目录里
It's gonna be inside
the source directory as well.

26
00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:37.225
>> Brian Holt: 我们将从 "反应"中导入 React 。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here we're going
to import React from 'react'.

27
00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:41.920
Say const SearchParams 将等于一个箭头函数。
Say const SearchParams is gonna
be equal to an arrow function.

28
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:47.317
> > Brian Holt: 我要给它点位置。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna
give it some location.

29
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.639
> > Brian Holt: 这样做会像西雅图和 WA一样。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is gonna
be something like Seattle, WA.

30
00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.662
>> Brian Holt: 确保该位置是美国的位置。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure that
this is an American location.

31
00:01:56.662 --> 00:02:00.075
我们将使用的 API 仅限于美国。
The API that we're gonna be
using is limited to the US.

32
00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:04.659
事实上，我现在只限制了西雅图和旧金山的空气污染指数。
And actually I've limited the API to just
Seattle and San Fransisco right now.

33
00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.483
所以也许选择其中之一。
So maybe choose one of those.

34
00:02:10.134 --> 00:02:14.439
> > Brian Holt: 我会在这里解释一下为什么。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'll explain why here in a second.

35
00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.651
因此，请在此处制作一个 div >> Brian Holt: And
So make a div here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

36
00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:22.877
所以我还没跟你解释
so one thing I haven't explained to you so

37
00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:26.644
这个挺重要的，我想给这个名字，对吧 ?
far that is pretty important is I
wanna give this a class name, right?

38
00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:34.150
通常，我只说类等于搜索 - params，就像这样。
So typically, I'll just say class
equals search-params, like this.

39
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.368
但通知会说我不知道课是什么
But notice it's gonna say,
I don't know what class is.

40
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.009
使用类时存在问题。
There's problem with using class.

41
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.789
问题是，类是 JavaScript 中的保留字。
And the issue is that class is
a reserved word in JavaScript.

42
00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:50.210
所以如果我说 " 宠物宠物 " 之类的话
So if I say something like class Pet or
something like that.

43
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.399
此处的类在 JavaScript 中有一个含义，对吧 ?
Class here has a meaning in JavaScript,
right?

44
00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.627
就像我不能说的， const class = blah，
Just like I can't say, const class = blah,

45
00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:02.259
因为这是个保留字对吧
is because this is a reserved word, right?

46
00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.139
意外关键字表示您不能将其用作变量名，对吗 ?
Unexpected keyword means it's a word that
you cannot use as a variable name, right?

47
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.629
我也不能叫这叫康斯特的
Same thing,
I can't have this called const,

48
00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.210
我不能让这个叫的对吧
I can't have this called let, right?

49
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.900
类是其中的另一个。
Class is another one of those.

50
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.590
那么我们如何使用 JSX来解决这一问题 ?
So how do we get around that with JSX?

51
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.528
那么，我们使用 JavaScript API 的名称，该名称是 className。
Well, we use the name of
the JavaScript API, which is a className.

52
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.060
他们没有发明这种方法，但这不是一种 " 重新发明 " 的限制。
They didn't invent this, but this was
not a limitation that React invented.

53
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.189
实际上，它也是 DOM API 的名称，所以
And actually,
it's the name of the DOM API as well, so

54
00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.639
也符合 DOM 的要求
it's consistent with
what the DOM calls it.

55
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.550
这就是为什么这是 className 而不是只是类，对吧 ?
So that's why this is className
instead of just class, right?

56
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.632
我知道人们觉得这很烦人，但它就是这样。
I understand that people find that
annoying, but it is what it is.

57
00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:41.699
> > Brian Holt: 好的，我们要在里面放一个表格。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
inside of that we're gonna put a form.

58
00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:49.479
在里面我们要有个标签和同样的东西在这里对吧
Inside of that we're gonna have a label
and same thing here with for, right?

59
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.908
这是另一个保留字，就像在循环中，对吧 ?
For is another reserve word,
as in for loop, right?

60
00:03:51.908 --> 00:03:54.171
所以 htmlFor
So htmlFor.

61
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.953
>> Brian Holt: 这是针对位置的。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is for the location.

62
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:07.615
>> Brian Holt: 在此范围内，我希望为其提供输入
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside of that,
I want to give it location with an input

63
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:13.311
>> Brian Holt: Id = "location"。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Id = "location".

64
00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:17.872
位置 =，然后我们把花括号放在这里
Location =, and
then we're gonna put curly braces here

65
00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:21.970
因为我们想把这里放在这里
because we want this location
here to be put there.

66
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.220
抱歉这不是地点这将是有价值的
Sorry, and this isn't gonna be location,
this is gonna be value.

67
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.156
值 = {location}。
Value = {location}.

68
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:35.019
>> Brian Holt: And 占位符 = "Location"。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
placeholder = "Location".

69
00:04:40.742 --> 00:04:45.558
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And underneath that
we're gonna have outside of that,

70
00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:49.766
在 " 表单 " 按钮的内部， " 提交" ，就像这样。
inside of the Form button,
Submit, like that.

71
00:04:55.807 --> 00:04:58.778
>> Brian Holt: 好的，请在此处汲取经验，导出缺省值。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
lesson down here, export default.

72
00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:02.548
>> Brian Holt: SearchParams。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchParams.

73
00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:06.848
>> Brian Holt: 最后一行。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Last line there.

74
00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:11.406
> > Brian Holt: 我们制作了这个新组件，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we've made this new component,

75
00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:14.247
就会像个搜索箱一样
that's gonna be a little like search box.

76
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.665
所以我们可以搜索宠物的不同方面，对，
So we can search for
various different facets of pets, right,

77
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.220
针对 Pet Finder API。
against the Pet Finder API.

78
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.029
它有一个内部有一个形式的 div 。
And it has a div with a form inside of it.

79
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.149
我们有一个有标签的输入。
And we have a input with a label for it.

80
00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:30.550
有些人也许会觉得这有点奇怪
Some of you might find this like
a little strange way to nest it.

81
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.980
这是你能做的
This is one way that you can do

82
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.159
标签中输入的标签。
labels that you put the input
inside of the label.

83
00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.290
还有其他的方法可以做到
There's other ways of doing it as well.

84
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.509
但最终，这对辅助功能是很有利的。
But in the end,
it's just good for accessibility.

85
00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.220
如果有人点击了它的位置
So that if someone clicks
on the location that it

86
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.819
输入正确的输入，对吗 ?
highlights the correct input, right?

87
00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:46.310
这就是我们要做的
That's ultimately what
we're going here for.

88
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.740
它会有西雅图的价值，华盛顿，对吧 ?
And it's gonna have a value of Seattle,
Washington, right?

89
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.040
所以，让我们先去了解 app.js。
So let's go ahead and
go render that out to app.js.

90
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.949
而不是 app.js， >> Brian Holt: 确保获取
So instead of app.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure you get

91
00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.569
啊，这个对。
this right.

92
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.216
我们可以删除所有评论过的东西
Yep, we can delete all this
stuff that we commented out.

93
00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:13.100
> > Brian Holt: 在此，我们不再从 Pet 导入。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here,
we're not gonna import from Pet anymore.

94
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.762
我们现在不能用宠物了
We cannot use Pet right now.

95
00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:20.543
我们会说，从 ./SearchParams 导入 SearchParams 。
We'll say,
import SearchParams from ./SearchParams.

96
00:06:22.848 --> 00:06:25.312
> > Brian Holt: 我们将删除所有这些宠物，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to
delete all these pets, and

97
00:06:25.312 --> 00:06:27.305
就像这样把 SearchParams 放了
just put SearchParams like that.

98
00:06:35.338 --> 00:06:38.880
>> Brian Holt: 好的，再一次打开 SearchParams ，以防您遗漏了什么。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, open SearchParams one
more time, in case you missed something.

99
00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.860
>> Brian Holt: 因此，我现在需要确保服务器正在运行。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now I need to make
sure that my server is running.

100
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.509
我的仍在运行，但确保您的正在运行。
Mine is still running, but
make sure yours is running.

101
00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.411
然后确保在此处打开 localhost 1234 。
And then make sure you
open localhost 1234 here.

102
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:57.529
我有点舞跳但没明确提到
Something I kind of danced around but
didn't explicitly mention was that.

103
00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.360
你不能做我之前给你展示的那种文件
You can't do that file open thing
that I was showing you before,

104
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.250
不能再工作了
that no longer works.

105
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.740
你得把这个包裹在包裹里的服务器上
You have to be loading this
off of Parcel's server, right?

106
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.870
这就是为什么必须关闭 localhost: 1234。
Which is why you have to open
it off of the localhost: 1234.

107
00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:15.569
> > Brian Holt: 所以我们要重新打开它，我在这里。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna open
that again, which I have up here.

108
00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.584
你可以看到我在西雅图有个地方
And you can see,
I have a location here, with Seattle,

109
00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:21.483
华盛顿有个 " 提交 " 的按钮对吧
Washington, with the Submit button there,
right?

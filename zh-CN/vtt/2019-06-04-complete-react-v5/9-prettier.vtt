00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
> > Brian Holt: 我们现在正在使用其他工具。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna go
through some other tools right now.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.346
我们要在这里安装的第一个将帮助我们
The first one that we're going to
install here is going to help us

3
00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:06.769
保持较高的代码质量。
keep high code quality.

4
00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:13.044
其中一个将是， >> Brian Holt: Prettier，好吗 ?
One of them is going to be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Prettier, okay?

5
00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:17.283
我想说的第一句话是 MPM 安装 -D，
So the first thing I'm gonna say down
here is I'm gonna say MPM install -D,

6
00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.739
这意味着它是开发者的附属关系对吧
which is gonna mean it's
a developer dependencies, right?

7
00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.859
所以当我把代码部署到生产
So when I'm deploying
my code to production

8
00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.280
我不需要和它一起去
I don't need to have Prettier go with it.

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.730
这只是我在当地的环境
This is just for
me on my local environment, and

10
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.250
我要把这类的更漂亮
I'm gonna put prettier like that.

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.963
现在可以说 npm 安装，我也是一个懒惰的人，所以
Now you can say npm install like this,
again, I'm a lazy person, so

12
00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:41.049
我喜欢无类型，所以我要把 npm - D ，就像这样。
I like to type less, so
I'm gonna put npm i -D, like that.

13
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.031
>> Brian Holt: 好的，现在看我的 package.json
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now if you look back at my package.json

14
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:55.024
你会在这里看到我有魔鬼附体
you'll see here that I
have devDependencies and

15
00:00:55.024 --> 00:01:00.015
它现在已经盯住了之前的 1.17 . > Brian Holt: Yours 可能
it has now pegged prettier 1.17
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yours might

16
00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.875
如果你将来这么做就不一样了
be different if you're
doing this in the future,

17
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.439
但这是一个比较稳定的项目所以你可以去做
but it's a relatively stable project so
you can go ahead and do that.

18
00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.049
现在我已经安装了 Prettier
So now I have Prettier installed, and

19
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.090
Prettier 将会做我能一直格式化我的项目的事情，对吧 ?
Prettier is going to do things where I can
format my project consistently, right?

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.739
我相信你们中的很多人都在研究一些档案
I'm sure many of you have worked on
projects where some files have tabs,

21
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.960
有些是有空间的，有些有拖尾的评论，
some of them have spaces,
some of them have trailing comments,

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.489
有些人是不会这样做的
some of them don't, so on and so forth.

23
00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:24.670
所以， Prettier 是一个项目，只是把所有对话都花在了
So Prettier is a project that kind of just
takes all the conversation out of that and

24
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.180
对格式进行标准化。
just standardizes on a format.

25
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.900
我承认对某些人来说他们不想放弃他们的格式
Now, I recognize, for some people,
they don't wanna let go of their format,

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.569
因为这是最好的方法他们先想到了
because it's the best one, and
they thought of it first, and

27
00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.120
我们都应该使用他们的格式因为他们比我们聪明多了对吧
we should all use their format because
they're much smarter than us, right?

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.246
我们都知道那个人，我们都不认识他们。
We all know that person,
and none of us like them.

29
00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:41.479
所以最漂亮的是把整个谈话都带走
So what Prettier does is it takes away
the whole conversation, it's like,

30
00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.450
不每个人都用同样的格式我们都被它困住了
no, everyone's gonna use the exact same
formatting, and we're all stuck with it.

31
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.884
这一切都和我们的选择略有不同
And it's all slightly different
than we would have chosen it, but

32
00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:50.491
我们都是一样的
we're all on the same format.

33
00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:53.429
> > Brian Holt: 这是我最喜欢的工具之一，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's actually
one of my favorite tools,

34
00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.081
因为我真的不关心我的代码长什么样
because I actually really don't care what
my code looks like as long as it's well

35
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.069
格式化，对吗 ?
formatted, right?

36
00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.400
只要有一个一致的格式，我就不管了。
As long as it has a format
that's consistent, I don't care.

37
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.950
最漂亮的是它是给你的
And the great thing about Prettier
is it just does it for you.

38
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.040
你可能注意到我一直在捣乱这些代码
So you've probably noticed that I've just
been messing around with all this code and

39
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.719
像这样做的地方就像超级恶心
doing stuff like this,
where it's like super gross, and

40
00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.110
一切都在走错线之类的对吧
everything's on the wrong line,
and stuff like that, right?

41
00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.659
读这种代码让你有点恶心不是吗
Reading this kind of code makes
you a little sick, doesn't it?

42
00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.590
但是有了 Prettier，如果我这样做，它就会把我的一切都解决了，
But with Prettier, if I just do this,
it just fixes everything for me, and

43
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.659
我从没想过要这样做对吧
I'd never have to think about this, right?

44
00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.670
我现在在我工作的每个公司都介绍过
I've now introduced it at every
company that I've worked at, and

45
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.429
我会继续为每一个我工作的公司工作。
I will continue doing it to every
company that I will work at.

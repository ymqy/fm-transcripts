00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
>> Brian Holt: 我们将在这里再创建一个文件。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are going
to create one more file here.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.700
这将会是一个 gitignore 文件。
This is going to be a gitignore file.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.555
因此，在源目录中，创建一个名为 .gitignore的文件。
So inside of your source directory,
create a file called .gitignore.

4
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:18.426
>> Brian Holt:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

5
00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.074
不是在你的源头里
Not inside your source one,

6
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:23.995
这将会进入您的根目录中
this is going to go inside of your
root directory inside of adopt me.

7
00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:31.297
> > Brian Holt: 如果你不熟悉，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
here if you are not familiar with get,

8
00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.435
这才是说说的意思是这里有一堆东西
this is just telling get is like,
here is a bunch of stuff,

9
00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:37.279
我不想让你跟踪我的忏悔
I don't want you to keep
a track of inside of my repo.

10
00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:40.710
好吧那就用点吧
Okay, so .getignore yes use dot.

11
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.686
所以你第一次不想追踪的是节点模块
So the first thing you never
want to track is node modules,

12
00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:47.411
因为这就是你晚上晚上可以安装的原因，对吧 ?
because that's why you can npm
install them wherever you want, right?

13
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:54.765
>> Brian Holt: 如果您在 Mac 上，您应该始终忽略 DS_Store，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then also if you're on
Mac you should always ignore DS_Store,

14
00:00:54.765 --> 00:01:01.609
这是麦克为了愚蠢的原因而创造的文件让我们不要谈论它
which is a file that Mac creates for
dumb reasons, let's not talk about it.

15
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.549
我们就说这些都是愚蠢的原因
Let's just say that they're dumb reasons.

16
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.189
然后在接下来的过程中，你会忽略你的缓存。
And then for later parts of the course,
you're going to ignore your cache.

17
00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.390
你会忽略 dist的
You're going to ignore dist.

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.909
你会忽略覆盖范围的
You're going to ignore coverage.

19
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.939
您可以忽略 dot VS Code 目录，也可以不忽略该目录。
You can ignore the dot VS Code
directory or not, that one's up to you.

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.019
就在 VS 代码记录下你个人喜好的项目上
It's just where VS Code keeps track of all
your personal preferences for the project,

21
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:27.460
然后你也会忽略 .emv 文件
and then you're also going
to ignore the .emv file.

22
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.659
所以这仅仅是对 < VS > 的解释，忽略所有这些东西，从不承诺这些东西。
So this is just telling VS Code, ignore
all this stuff, never commit this stuff.

23
00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.411
这就是我给我的东西，不给我放进去的东西
This is stuff that I just have for
me and not to be put in my get

24
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:46.070
repo >> Brian Holt: 好的，
repo
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

25
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.450
所以这里还有一个 commit point 。
so there's another commit point here.

26
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.530
所以如果你在工装后面摔下来，你就可以跳下去了
So if you fell people behind the tooling
you can feel free to just jump up to

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.060
这个承诺。
this commit.

28
00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.750
这就像添加 npm 脚本和 ES Lint 和 prettier 一样
It's something called like add npm
scripts and ES Lint and prettier and

29
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.990
就像这样
things like that.

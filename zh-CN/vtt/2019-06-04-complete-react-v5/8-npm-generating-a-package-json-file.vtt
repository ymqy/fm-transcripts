00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.490
> > Brian Holt: 到目前为止我们谈论的是 JustReact，
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
far we've been talking about JustReact,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.339
你永远不会看到有人利用朱斯特雷法对吧
and you'll never see anyone
using JustReact, right?

3
00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.410
就像我们一直在做的那样，这并不是一个非常普遍的模式
Like we've been doing so far,
that's just not a very common pattern for

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.189
写 React ，总是有工具的，对吧 ?
writing React,
there's always tools involve, right?

5
00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.255
这也是我的方法，我也来自前端的基础设施。
And that again, my methodology, and I come
from front end infrastructure as well.

6
00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.719
所以我要去做我疯狂的人
So I'm going to subject to my madness,
is that you need to

7
00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:23.739
除了了解框架外，还了解您的工具。
understand your tools in addition to
just understanding the framework.

8
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.769
所以我尽量保持尽量轻但我还是会帮你
So, I'm gonna keep as light as possible,
but I'm going to still help you

9
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.440
理解我的意见中的一些更有效的写作方法
understand some of the better ways
to write React in my opinion.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.406
我们要把你介绍给你三四个工具
So, here we're gonna introduce you
to like, three or four tools, and

11
00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:38.149
那我们就能回去写雷法了
then we'll get back to writing React.

12
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.750
所以我想给你介绍的第一个，你可能已经熟悉了 NPM。
So the first one I wanna introduce you to,
you may already be familiar with is NPM.

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.375
这不代表节点软件包管理器，但代表了
Which does not stand for node package
manager, but sort of stands for

14
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.633
节点软件包管理器。
node package manager.

15
00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:55.536
>> Brian Holt: 这将允许我们，而不是仅将节点装入
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is going to allow us
to, rather than just loading node off of

16
00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:59.960
CDN ，我们会把它安装在注册中心，并建造我们的项目。
the CDN, we're gonna actually install it
off of the registry and build our project.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.850
所以它其实是包里的，
So that it's actually included
with the package, and

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.290
我们不需要依赖包裹来对吧
we don't have to rely on
unpackage to be up, right?

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.469
解包非常好，就像测试东西一样。
Unpackage is really good for
just like testing things out.

20
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.212
但不依赖它来生产交通，
But do not rely on it for
production traffic,

21
00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:12.676
然后你就任人宰割了好吗
cuz then you're at their mercy, okay?

22
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.489
>> Brian Holt: 我要你做的是，我要你打开你的终端。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, what I want you to do,
is I want you to open your terminal.

23
00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.840
这是内置的 VS 代码 ( 如果您正在使用该代码 ) 。
This is built-in the VS code,
if you are using that.

24
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.614
您可以打开命令，或抱歉，控制，后退，斜杠，
You can open up with command, or sorry,
control, back tick, slash tilde,

25
00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:30.305
就在你的键盘旁边的那个
the one that's next to
the one on your keyboard.

26
00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:36.028
>> Brian Holt: 在其他地方也有很多按钮
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's plenty of
buttons somewhere for as well but

27
00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.847
我就是这样自己打开的好吗
that's how I was open itself, okay?

28
00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:38.859
然后第一件事
And then the first thing,

29
00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.400
您必须确保已安装节点。
you're gonna have to make sure
that you have node installed.

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.379
所以我有 10个， 15个，只要你说 8 个，
So I do, I have 10, 15, as long as
you're over like, let's say eight,

31
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:48.370
六岁的小熊被弃用了
cuz six just got deprecated.

32
00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.299
或者说生命的终结是正确的术语。
Or end of life, rather,
is the correct term.

33
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.638
所以只要你在 8 岁以上就可以了
So as long as you're above eight,
you should be fine.

34
00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:57.920
我在 10 . 15 岁，现在应该很接近 LTS 了。
I'm on 10.15, which should be
pretty close to the LTS right now.

35
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.170
你想用的就是这个
Which is the one that you wanna use.

36
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.400
我认为你应该使用长期支持的 LTS 。
You should use the LTS which stands for
long-term support, I think.

37
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.608
或者我是在说你可以相信我
Or I'm making that up and
you can believe me.

38
00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:10.456
好了节点来了
Okay, so with node comes mpm,

39
00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:15.289
如果您现在没有安装这些工具。
if you don't have these
tools installed right now.

40
00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:21.947
只要去 nodejs.org 你也可以在那边安装就好了。
Just go to nodejs.org, and you can just
install it right after there as well.

41
00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.318
>> Brian Holt: 因此请注意，我在桌面/采用者中
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
notice that I'm in Desktop/adopt-me, so

42
00:02:29.318 --> 00:02:31.144
我在我的项目目录里
I'm inside of my project directory.

43
00:02:31.144 --> 00:02:35.361
我想做的第一件事就是晚上的晚上
And the first thing that I wanna
do is I'm gonna say npm init,

44
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:38.520
这将为我创造一个新的项目
which is going to create a new project for
me.

45
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240
现在我超级懒惰我不想回答任何问题
Now, I'm super lazy and
I don't wanna answer any of the questions.

46
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.329
所以支持提示如果你放了我就不会问你任何问题
So pro tip, if you put -y,
it won't ask you any questions and

47
00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.550
它会为您生成一个文件。
it just generates a file for you.

48
00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.250
否则，您会收到此交互式提示。
Otherwise you get this interactive prompt.

49
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.360
比如你的项目名称
Like what's the name of your project?

50
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.259
你是谁，什么都怪我，我就是个不烦的人。
Who are you, blah blah blah,
and I just can't be bothered.

51
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.086
现在，如果你看看我的项目，你可以看到我有一个 package.json。
So, now if you look at my project, you
can see here that I have a package.json.

52
00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:06.610
现在，这与 JavaScript 项目很常见。
Now, this is common with
JavaScript projects.

53
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.669
再次，这可能不是你第一次接触这一问题。
Again, this may not be the first
time you've been exposed to this.

54
00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.840
在这里关闭这个
Inside of here, close this.

55
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.479
只是一个 JSON 文件里充满了许可证的内容
It's just a JSON file full
of what the license is,

56
00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.460
项目的名称是什么，版本是什么，等等。
what the name of the project is,
what version it is, so on and so forth.

57
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.099
我们真的不关心这里发生了什么
We don't actually really
care what's going on here.

58
00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.210
如果你想的话你可以搞砸了
You can mess with it if you want to.

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.776
我不会去的
I'm not going to.

60
00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:29.009
但有几件事我们会关注的
But there's a couple of things that
we're gonna be concerned with here.

61
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.939
首先我们要有依赖性
First one,
we're gonna have dependencies and

62
00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.889
那些依赖性就会被跟踪到这里对吧
those dependencies are gonna
be track in here, right?

63
00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:34.490
那就
So then,

64
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.189
每当我说 npm 安装时，就会有同样的依赖性，对吧 ?
whenever I say npm install, it's going
to grab the same dependencies, right?

65
00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:44.430
所以如果我和开始一起研究一个项目，我可以向她展示一下。
So if me and Start working on a project
together, I can show this with her.

66
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.819
我们可以一起研究这个项目，对吧 ?
And we could work together
on that project, right?

67
00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.781
就像这样
Something like that.

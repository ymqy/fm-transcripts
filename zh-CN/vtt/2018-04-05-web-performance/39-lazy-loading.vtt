00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.519
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：我们将进入我认为是皇冠上的宝石
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're going to move
into what I think is the crown jewel

2
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.740
我们今天谈论的很多东西。
of a lot of stuff we've
been talking about today.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.779
首先想象一下JavaScript性能和网络性能。
Imagine first the JavaScript performance
and the network performance.

4
00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.519
如果我说，你可以用一个诡异的把戏戏剧性地修复两者，对吗？
If I said, you can fix both dramatically
with one weird trick, right?

5
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.960
你会点击那个链接诱饵文章，你完全会的，对吧？
You'd click that link bait article,
you totally would, right?

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.160
所以我们来谈谈这个，
So let's talk about that,

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.980
这是惰性加载和预加载与反应和webpack。
which is lazy-loading and
pre-loading with React and webpack.

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.239
我们知道Javascript是要付出代价的，对吧？
We know that there's a cost to Javascript,
right?

9
00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.175
我们知道网络是有成本的，对吧？
We know that there is a cost
to the network, right?

10
00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:34.310
如果我们能减少一点那就太酷了。
It'd be cool if we could
reduce that a little bit.

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.899
首先，为了表明我的观点，我要出去
First, just to kinda make my
point I'm gonna go out for

12
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.060
又是两条金科玉律。
the two golden rules again.

13
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.630
不做事比做事快。
Not doing stuff is
faster than doing stuff.

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.119
这是我认为第一个的改写版本。
This is I think a reworded
version of the first one.

15
00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:50.679
以后再做事情是现在不做的一种方式，因此更快，对吧？
Doing stuff later is a way to not do
it now, and is thereby faster, right?

16
00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.390
因为这是现在不做的一个版本。
Cuz it's a version of not doing it now.

17
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.289
所以有一条来自Sean Larkin的推文，他在Webpack团队工作。
So there's a tweet from Sean Larkin
who works in the Webpack team.

18
00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.009
这有点像设定了一个捆绑包的目标，所有的捆绑包，
It's kind of setting a goal of bundles,
all bundles,

19
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.049
所有JavaScript小于300KB。
all JavaScript being
less than 300 kilobytes.

20
00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.569
你就像，但是你给我看了一个图表，而且这个图表很大，[笑]对吗？
You're like, but you showed me a graph,
and the graph is big, [LAUGH] right?

21
00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:10.200
我的应用程序在完全加载时是我认为
My application when
fully loaded is I think

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.659
就像5兆字节的东西，贯穿整个过程。
like five megabytes of stuff,
the whole way through.

23
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.989
但请注意，这里有一个词是懒惰的或者不是。
But notice there,
there's a word kind of lazily or not.

24
00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:21.989
如果你不是一下子就需要所有的东西呢。
What if you don't need
everything all at once.

25
00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:25.150
所以，我认为我正在开发的应用程序是Ingrid，对吗？
So, I think about the app I
working on is InGrid, right?

26
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.960
有一个完整的编辑器用于操作活动，还有一个代码编辑器和
There's a full editor for manipulating
campaigns, and there's a code editor and

27
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.340
所有这些疯狂的事情。
there's all of these crazy things.

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.259
有一种东西可以上传你的联系人和
There's a thing for
uploading your contacts and

29
00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.718
一堆不同的特征。
a bunch of different features.

30
00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:41.939
我不知道那个人来那里做什么，所以我把所有的东西都寄给他们了，对吧？
I don't know what the person came there
to do, so I send them everything, right?

31
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.460
他们可能不需要整个DragonDrop编辑器
They might not need that
entire DragonDrop editor and

32
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.789
WizzyWig文本编辑器喜欢唤醒和风格之类的东西。
the WizzyWig text editor like wake and
style stuff.

33
00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.219
如果使用代码编辑器，则可能不需要代码编辑器。
They might not need the code
editor if they're using that.

34
00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.539
如果他们只是上传一些新的上下文，他们可能不需要这两个。
They might not need either of those if
they're just uploading some new context.

35
00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.450
如果他们只是去调整一些设置或者
They might not need even that if they are
just going and tweaking some settings or

36
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.969
处理我们发送给他们的一些警报，或者
dealing with some alert that we sent them,
or

37
00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.290
检查他们最近竞选活动的统计数据，对吧？
checking on the stats of their
most recent campaign, right?

38
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.620
但现在
But right now, and

39
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.270
我正在努力解决这个问题，但现在，我们把所有东西都寄给他们了，对吧？
I'm working on fixing this, but right now,
we send them absolutely everything, right?

40
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.710
他们收到所有这些代码，他们必须将这些代码打包。
And they receive all this code,
they have to parcel this code.

41
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.530
就像他们付出了那样的代价，
Like they pay that cost,

42
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.520
这是一个巨大的黄色鼻涕虫，我在我们应用程序的屏幕截图中向您展示了它。
that's a giant yellow slug that I showed
you on the screen shot of our application.

43
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.349
公平地说，这是我们在该页面上的拖放编辑器。
In fairness that is our drag and
drop editor on that page.

44
00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.079
但考虑到我说了同样的话无论如何，
But considering I said in
the same bundle no matter what,

45
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.930
他们不管怎样都要付出这个代价。
they're paying that cost regardless.

46
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.039
所以如果我能给他们发送更少的代码，他们必须喜欢，
So if I can send them less code,
they have to like,

47
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.050
更少的代码必须通过管道。
less code has to go through the tube.

48
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.759
在管道的另一边出现的代码更少，这意味着他们必须
Less code shows up at the other side
of the tube which means they have to

49
00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.000
少解析代码，好吗？
parse less code, all right?

50
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.969
如果他们解析更少的代码，那会更快，因为我们看到的所有疯狂的东西
If they parse less code, that's gonna be
faster, cuz all the crazy stuff we saw

51
00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.310
早些时候，不这样做比做要快，对吧？
earlier, not doing that is
faster than doing it, right?

52
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.340
然后我们可以给他们看
And then we can show them,

53
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.110
然后，如果他们想去编辑，我会把代码发给他们，对吗？
then if they want to go to the editor,
I'll send them that code later, right?

54
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.969
我不会给他们发送模型空间代码编辑器，上下文上传的东西。
And I won't send them the model space
code editor, the context uploading thing.

55
00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.389
因为他们需要东西，我会寄给他们比他们多一点的东西
As they need stuff,
I will send them small bits more that they

56
00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.840
实际上需要在他们通过申请时，对吗？
actually need as they go
through the application, right?

57
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.240
因为以后做是现在不做的一种方式，现在不做更快。
Cuz doing it later is a way to not do
it now, and not doing it now is faster.

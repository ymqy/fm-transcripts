00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.758
&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：这一部分的大外卖。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Large takeaways
from this entire section.

2
00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:04.628
所有这些都很酷，但是
All these are immediately cool, but

3
00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:07.469
在这门课结束时，我会给你一个专业的建议。
I'm going to give you a pro
tip at the end of this course.

4
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.179
这些都不如将更少的JavaScript转移到浏览器中那么酷。
None of these are as cool as just
shifting less JavaScript to the browser.

5
00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.730
对，因为你转换的JavaScript越少，这些东西就越不重要。
Right, because the less JavaScript you
shift, the less any of this stuff matters.

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.640
对，但是用户计时API，性能标记和
Right, but the user timing API,
the performance mark and

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.339
性能度量，这在您的实际应用程序中是非常有用的。
performance measure, that can be super
useful in your real world applications.

8
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.757
你可以继续，你现在就可以把它放进去，对吧，
You can go ahead, and
you can drop that in right now, right,

9
00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:28.949
进入您的应用程序的某些部分，您怀疑它很慢，对吗？
into parts of your application that
you're suspicious of being slow, right?

10
00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.409
你可以做录音，你可以看到我看到的那个更大的，而且
You can do the recording,
you can see that larger I saw, and

11
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.500
然后您可以实际操作，因为您比V8更了解您的代码。
then you can actual actions, cuz you know
your code better than v8 does right.

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.009
你可以继续
You can go ahead and

13
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.979
放下那一端，你实际上可以测量这个过程需要多长时间。
drop that end and you can actually
meter how long is this taking.

14
00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.880
你可以做一件事，比如，一开始很酷，但是
You can do a thing, like,
that was cool for a start of time but

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.479
也许慢的东西拖着
maybe the slow thing is dragging and

16
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.130
在应用程序中删除某些内容，例如更新内容。
dropping something in your application,
like updating the thing.

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.670
如果你必须找出这个有多低，你实际上可以使用一个时间，
You can actually use a timing if you
have to find out how low is this,

18
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.020
这就是受伤的地方吗？
is this where the hurt is?

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.530
也许是，也许不是。
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

20
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.329
然后，最后我们看到可能使用类型系统
And then, finally we saw that
maybe using a type system

21
00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.789
免费为您提供性能提升。
gives you performance gains for free.

22
00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.560
我认为这也很有帮助。
I think that's really helpful as well.

23
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.280
很酷。
Very cool.

24
00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.605
我们休息一下吃午饭吧。
Let's break for lunch.

25
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.280
然后我们会进入浏览器
And then we'll actually
get into the browser and

26
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.489
看看我们看到的JavaScript是怎样的。
see how everything we saw JavaScript.

27
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:17.489
这是如何与HTML和CSS以及dom和所有那些疯狂的东西交互的。
How does this interact with HTML and
CSS and the dom and all that crazy stuff.

28
00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:19.689
我们将实际看到网页是如何诞生的。
We'll actually see how web pages are born.

29
00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.969
一只鹳实际上把它们带到了浏览器，这很酷。
A stork actually brings them to
the browser, it's very cool.

30
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.769
从云中，它从云中下降，并带来它们，这是非常酷的。
From the cloud, it descends out of
the cloud and brings them, it's very cool.

31
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:26.280
好吧。
All right.

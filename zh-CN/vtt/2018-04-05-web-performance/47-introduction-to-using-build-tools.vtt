&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：最后一个话题是我们一直在跳舞
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So one kind of final
topic is we've been kind of dancing around

2
00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.939
使用您的构建工具来帮助您的想法。
this idea of using your
build tools to help you.

3
00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.929
我们的构建工具有很多好的方面和不好的方面。
And our build tools have a lot
of good things and bad things.

4
00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.179
最棒的是它们是自动化的。
The best part is that they're automated.

5
00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.989
贯穿始终，我们看到了Optimizely，它可以使用启发式来尝试可能的速度
Going through, we saw Optimizely which can
use the heuristics to try to maybe speed

6
00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.339
提高你的代码。
up your code.

7
00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.699
我们甚至看到Babble low Dash有能力进去
We even saw Babble low dash has
the ability to go in there and

8
00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.989
做代码抖动，
do the code shaking,

9
00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.020
树的摇动不会带来你不需要的低破折号的部分，对吗？
the tree shaking to not bring in parts
of low dash that you don't need right?

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.740
我们已经看到工具可以做很多这样的事情，很多时候如果你
We've seen that tools can do a lot of
these things, and a lot of times if you

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.840
可以自动化的东西，你会做得比你试图用手做得更好。
can automate something, you're gonna do it
better than if you try to do it by hand.

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
说服你的整个团队用手去做，永远不要搞砸，对吗？
Convince your entire team to do it
by hand and never mess up, right?

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.850
因此，有很多很好的工具可以做到这一点。
So there's a lot of great tools for that.

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.420
这个叫做Purify CSS，它真的很棒，因为它所做的就是它看起来
This one's called Purify CSS and it's
really great cuz what it does is it looks

15
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.850
就像你的CSS文件一样，它剥离了所有你实际上没有使用的CSS。
like your CSS file and it strips out all
the CSS that you're not actually using.

16
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.070
我们在Render ed Performance一节中谈到了这一点。
We talked about that in the render
ed performance section.

17
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.869
嘿，如果你有更少的CSS，你可以更快地进行选择器匹配。
Hey, if you have less CSS,
you can do the selector matching faster.

18
00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.489
你可以通过手工对它进行微调，对吗？
You can go through and
fine-tune it by hand, right?

19
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:08.480
这是一个选择。
That's an option.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.150
而且您可能会比这个工具做得更好，但是
And you'll probably do a better
job than this tool would, but

21
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.629
还有把事情搞砸的风险，事实上你必须这么做，
also the risk of messing it up,
the fact that you actually have to do it,

22
00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:18.390
你必须保持它的最新的事实，对吗？
the fact you have to keep it up to date,
right?

23
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.890
有一些工具可以帮助我们。
There are tools that can kinda help us.

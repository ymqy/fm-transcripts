00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:07.884
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：结束的想法，建议和未来的研究。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Closing thoughts,
recommendations, and future research.

2
00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:11.515
[大笑]嘿，记住这个提示，只要确保你的应用程序处于生产模式
[LAUGH] Hey, remember this tip, just
make sure your app is in production mode

3
00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:14.009
无论这对您的框架意味着什么。
whatever that means for your framework.

4
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.239
因为在开发模式中会发生很多实际的事情
Cuz there's a lot of actual stuff
that happens in development mode that

5
00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.839
让你的生活更轻松。
makes your life easier.

6
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.250
就像没有理由，我这么说是因为我不小心射中了我的
That like there is no reason and I say
this cuz like I have accidentally shoot my

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.338
自己的应用程序和开发[INAUDIBLE]之前。
own app and
development [INAUDIBLE] before.

8
00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:26.390
我去参观了一个正在进行的制作，为什么它是橙色的？
I've gone to visit a production going,
why is it orange?

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.719
我找到了他，就像网络包下垂的顺序是错误的。
I got to him like order of
web pack flagging is wrong.

10
00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.920
就像我在运行[INAUDIBLE]后对生产环境所说的那样。
Like I said to production
environment after I ran [INAUDIBLE].

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.009
所以[INAUDIBLE]已经知道所有的支票都被剥离了
So it was already [INAUDIBLE] knows
all the checks were stripped out and

12
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.109
那么我设置生产模式对吗？
then I set production mode right?

13
00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.140
所以毫无疑问，这很重要
So definitely, it matters so

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.789
很多，对，值得再重复一遍。
much, right,
that it's worth repeating one more time.

15
00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.170
所以是的，没有反应。
So yeah, doesn't react.

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.670
它占用了PropTypes，接受了所有有用的警告，
It takes up PropTypes,
takes all the helpful warnings,

17
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.939
不做绩效指标。
doesn't do performance metrics.

18
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:56.170
只是一般说来。
It's just generally speaking.

19
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.100
如果您认为在开发代码时存在性能问题。
And if you think you have a performance
problem as you're developing code.

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.899
首先为生产构建它，看看是否仍然有问题。
Build it for production first, and
see if you still have a problem.

21
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.840
我失去了我生命中的日子，我再也回不来了，
I have lost days of my life,
that I will never get back,

22
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.109
跟踪不存在的性能问题。
tracking down performance
problems that didn't exist.

23
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.950
它们只存在于发展中。
They only existed in development.

24
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
你去看看，他们不在那里，对吧？
You go and you look, and
they're not there, right?

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.724
这就是为什么我重复这个，因为不要那样，保持那些日子。
That's why I'm repeating this one, because
don't be like that, keep those days.

26
00:01:19.724 --> 00:01:22.120
[笑]别下去。
[LAUGH] Don't go down.

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.500
我这里有伤疤组织给你。
I have the scar tissue here for you.

28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
你没必要这么做。
You don't have to do this.

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.280
我已经说了够多次了
I'm saying this enough times so

30
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.810
在调试20分钟后，你会想，我是为生产而构建的吗？
that 20 minutes into debugging you'll
be like, have I built for production?

31
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.039
让我为生产而建，看看这是不是一件事。
Let me built for production and
see if that's a thing.

32
00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.579
如果我能在某一时刻为一个人节省一小时
And if I can save one person
an hour at some point

33
00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.650
我要把这整件事称为胜利。
I'm going to call this entire thing a win.

34
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.930
当您处于生产模式时，您可以看到它是橙色的。
You see it's orange when
you're in production mode.

35
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.259
当你在开发模式中处于橙色时，它是黑色的，
It's black when you are in
orange in development mode,

36
00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.789
黑色生产模式。
black in production mode.

37
00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.659
就像这个帮助一样，如果你点击它，就会出现错误信息。
Like with this help for
error message if you click on it.

38
00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.349
不管你选择的框架是什么，
Whatever your framework of choice is,

39
00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.125
很可能有一个像这样的不同的工具，只是确保你正在使用它。
likely has a different tool like this
just make sure that you're using it.

40
00:01:55.125 --> 00:02:00.355
很酷，所以网络表现是一个巨大的话题，就像一个不只是一天的话题。
Cool, so web performance is a giant topic,
like more than a one-day topic.

41
00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:04.500
还有很多事情我们今天没有谈到。
And there's a lot of things that
we didn't get to talk about today.

42
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.215
服务器端呈现就是JavaScript需要花费时间来解析的想法。
Server-side rendering is this idea that
your JavaScript takes time to parse.

43
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:10.215
腿部负荷需要时间。
It takes time to leg load.

44
00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:11.784
如果你寄给他们一个常客，
What if you sent them a regular,

45
00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:15.314
旧的HTML页面，然后你把其他东西都加载了吗？
old HTML page and
then you got everything else loaded?

46
00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:17.099
现在，根据你的申请，
Now, depending on your application,

47
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.199
如果是纽约时报，你可以把内容发给他们，没问题。
if it's the New York Times you can
send them the content no problem.

48
00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.389
如果是推特，那么你得弄清楚他们的时间线，
If it's Twitter, well you've got to
do some figuring out their timeline,

49
00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.300
您需要在服务器端完成所有这些工作。
you need to do all of that server-side.

50
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.270
不同的框架对此有不同的级别支持。
Different frameworks have
different level support for this.

51
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.930
恩伯是第一个，我相信，角度和反应都有支持
Ember was one of the first, I believe,
Angular and React both have support for

52
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.870
例如，IT但骨干可能不会。
it but Backbone, for instance, might not.

53
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.199
因此，它可能是您可以使用或可能不使用的东西。
So it might be something you can use or
might not use.

54
00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.370
图像性能，我们开玩笑说取出一兆字节的JPEG是
Image performance, we joked that
taking out a megabyte of JPEGs is

55
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.509
不如取出一兆字节的JavaScript那么好。
not as good as taking out
a megabyte of JavaScript.

56
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.750
但也可以取出一兆字节的JPEG图像。
But also taking out
a megabyte of JPEGs is good.

57
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.009
所以你可以看到Medium做了一些非常有趣的事情。
So you can see Medium does
really interesting things.

58
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.599
他们给你看了一个模糊的版本，真的很低的分辨率。
Where they show you a blurred out
version that's really low res.

59
00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.099
然后当你滚动到那个部分，他们就会加载图像。
And then when you scroll to that
part then they load the image.

60
00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.669
所以你不会马上把你的图片发到文章下面六页。
So you're not sending your images for like
six pages down the article immediately.

61
00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.810
他们等待，直到您的滚动事件获得该图像，然后加载它。
They wait until your scroll event gets
that image and then they load it.

62
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.909
在那里你可以做很多很酷的事情。
There's a bunch of cool
stuff you can do there.

63
00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.909
性能的最大瓶颈之一是Web字体。
One of the biggest bottlenecks
on performance is web fonts.

64
00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.210
谁不喜欢好的网页字体，对吧？
Who doesn't love a good web font, right?

65
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.370
但他们可能是，你看过你什么都看不到的页面吗？
But they can be, you've seen the page
where you're seeing nothing?

66
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.780
在字体加载之前，这并不是很好。
Until the font loads, that's not great.

67
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.680
Chrome实际上有一些非常有趣的工具，基本上，
Chrome actually has some really
interesting tools, where it's basically,

68
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.509
你实际上可以有一个你说，嘿，这就是我想要的字体的设置。
you can actually have a setting where
you say, hey, this is the font I want.

69
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.170
但如果时间太长，就用另一种字体，比如乔治亚，
But if it takes too long,
just use this other font, like Georgia,

70
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.909
或者Helvetica之类的
or Helvetica, or whatever.

71
00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.039
最后，我之前提到过进步的Web应用程序。
And then finally, I kinda mentioned this
before about progressive web applications.

72
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.949
我认为这绝对非常重要
I think it's definitely,
incredibly important and

73
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.610
有趣的领域仍然在Safari中出现。
interesting field that's
still emerging in Safari.

74
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.039
然后beta现在将支持服务工作者，因此，
And then beta will now support
the service worker and so,

75
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.129
是的，打乱了离线工作，可以在后台同步。
yeah having upset work offline
that can sync in the background.

76
00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.876
在我找到更多东西的时候可以马上给你看一样东西
And can show you a thing
immediately while I find more stuff

77
00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:54.485
也是令人难以置信的强大。
is incredibly powerful as well.

78
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:57.656
这本身就是一个两天的话题，所以
It was a two day topic in and
of itself, so

79
00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:02.496
就像，很难挤进其他所有的东西中。
like, hard to also squeeze
in amongst everything else.

80
00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:03.485
非常感谢。
Thank you so much.

00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.660
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：我想让你试着回到过去，
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I want
you to try to do is go back,

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.360
原来以前的codepen已经在全球范围内快速下载了。
turns out that codepen from before
has fast downloaded globally.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.919
我想让你尝试的是
What I'd love you to try is for

4
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.820
加倍的条形图，尽量使用快速网点。
the doubling of the bars,
to try to use fast dot.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.640
继续，我们把它分成两个函数。
Go ahead and
we broke it out into two functions.

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.559
我们遍历了这些盒子的整个阵列斜杠。
We ran through the entire array
of those boxes slash bars.

7
00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.670
我们测量了它们，然后我们第二次遍历阵列
We measured them all, then we ran
through the array a second time and

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.769
都变异了。
mutated them all.

9
00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.820
我们可以使用FASTON吗，它基本上是从几乎原始代码开始的
Could we use FASTON, which is basically
starting out with almost the original code

10
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.270
我们有，把它包装在度量中，然后当我们变异它时，
we had, wrap that in the measure,
and then for when we mutate it,

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.399
将其包装在faston.mutate中，让我们看看有什么不同。
wrap that in faston.mutate and
let's see what the differences are.

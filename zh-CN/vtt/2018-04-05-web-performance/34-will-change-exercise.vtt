00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.839
&gt；&gt；steve kinney：有，我们很快就会看一看。
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is,
we're going to take a look real quick.

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:03.819
我会关掉这张幻灯片。
I'll switch off this slide.

3
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:05.389
我们将看一下“油漆风暴”示例。
We'll look at the "Paint
Storming" example.

4
00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:08.869
我们会先看一眼，我们现在就会看到它会引起油漆风暴。
We'll take a first look and we'll see
right now it causes a paint storm.

5
00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.859
我们想要做的是折射它，所以
What we want to do is we
want to refractor it, so

6
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.420
当鼠标进入时，它会向上移动到它自己的层。
that when the mouse enters it
moves up to it's own layer.

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.839
然后当它结束时，我们把它放回去，或者当鼠标离开的时候。
And then when it ends, we put it
back down or when the mouse leaves.

8
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.300
所以让我们来看一下代码
So let's take a look at the code and

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.129
那我会给你一些时间来玩这个。
then I'll give you some time
to play around with this.

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.054
因此，让我们首先在浏览器中实际查看它。
So let's actually look at
it in the browser first.

11
00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.219
我不再需要特殊的，超级特殊的模式了。
I don't need the special,
super special mode anymore.

12
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.982
我们要画风暴，我有这个红色的盒子，点击它，看看
We're going to paint storming, I've got
this red box, click on it, look at that

13
00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:46.500
小小的绿色阵列油漆跟随它，让我们刷新这个，看起来很有趣。
little green array paint follow it,
let's refresh this, it's fun to watch.

14
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.130
我们要画，就像一场小小的油漆风暴，
We're going to paint, and
it's like a little paint storm,

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.259
它只是重绘每一个像素。
it's just repainting every pixel.

16
00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.679
好吧这是什么？
All right, what is this?

17
00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:02.170
因此，如果我们查看代码并查看
So if we look at the code and
we look under

18
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.579
搬家的箱子，以为那是另一个，油漆风暴。
moving boxes, thought that was
the other one, paint storming.

19
00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.469
酷毙了。我们在油漆风暴下寻找。
Cool.
We look under paint storming.

20
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.210
忽略有一个解决方案目录，它并不重要。
Ignore that there is a solutions
directory, it is not important.

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.680
不关注解决方案目录。
Pay no attention to
the solutions directory.

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.200
我们将使用jQuery制作动画，因为10年前，
We are going to use jQuery for
animation because 10 years ago, and

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840
这就是我们现在正在做的。
that's what we're doing right now.

24
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.140
你可以看到这是使用JavaScript来调整
And you can see that that's
using JavaScript to adjust

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.560
左边，好吗？
the marginLeft, all right?

26
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.450
改变内联风格也就不足为奇了，
And it's not surprising that
that changes the inline style,

27
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.400
这会触发重新粉刷，在这种情况下，对吗？
which triggers a repaint,
in this case, right?

28
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.640
我们在每一帧上都这样做，让我们实际测量一下。
And we're doing it on every frame, and
let's actually measure it for a second.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.021
让我们看看这里发生了什么。
Let's see what's going on here.

30
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.781
我们会刷新。
We'll refresh.

31
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:44.381
我要关掉闪烁的油漆
I'm going to turn off the paint flashing

32
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:47.902
当您还尝试收集性能指标时。
when you also try to collect
the performance metrics.

33
00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:51.509
否则，事情将变得糟糕得可怕，因为浏览器也试图
Otherwise, things will be horrifyingly
bad because the browser is also trying to

34
00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.870
画那些绿色的方块，你会得到噪音。
paint all those green squares and
you'll get noise.

35
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.539
所以你关掉油漆闪光。
So you turn off the paint flashing.

36
00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.072
单击它。&gt；&gt；steve kinney：和
Click it.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

37
00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:04.689
这是把那个盒子超过500像素的过程，对吗？
this is the process of getting
that box 500 pixels over, right?

38
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.340
我们可以放大，我们可以看到一些JavaScript，
And we can zoom in,
we can see that there's some JavaScript,

39
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.219
有一个重新计算的风格，有一个布局，有一个更新层托盘。
there is a recalculated style, there's
a layout, there's an update layer tray.

40
00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.560
合成一些层，我们反复这样做。
Composite some layers, and
we're doing this repeatedly.

41
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.039
所以不这样做会很棒，因为这是工作。
So it would be great to not do this,
cuz this is work.

42
00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.000
不做工作比做工作快。
Not doing work is faster than doing work.

43
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.036
所以我们看一下代码。&gt；&gt；Steve Kinney：那里
So we look at the code.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There

44
00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:33.591
是这个移动类，它似乎知道如何让它一路走过来，而且
is this move class, which seems to know
how to get it all the way over, and

45
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.300
看起来确实有转变。
there does seem to be a transition.

46
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.228
因此，如果我们应用Move类而不是作为jQuery进行操作，
So if we apply that move class
instead of doing it as a jQuery,

47
00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.509
我们可以只使用CSS转换，对吗？
we could just use CSS transitions, right?

48
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.120
似乎在单击上我们想说的是添加Move类和
Seems like maybe on click what we want
to say is add that move class and

49
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.449
它应该会移动。
it should move.

50
00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.750
但我们仍然在制作自己的图层，同时移动，所以
But then we're still making it's own
layer and moving at the same time so

51
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.370
我们可能需要编写一些额外的JavaScript才能移动它。
we're probably going to need to write some
extra JavaScript to be able to move it.

52
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.689
所以现在轮到你试一试，然后我们一起做。
So this is your turn to give it a shot,
then we'll do it together.

53
00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.020
所以我要把这张幻灯片放在
So I'm gonna put this slide up for

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.610
一秒钟，然后我会回到我们之前看到的另一个代码，然后
a second, but then I'm gonna go back to
that other code that we saw earlier, and

55
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.780
那就是我要把它冻结一段时间的地方。
that'll be where I freeze it for
a little bit.

56
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.750
但你的工作是摆脱jQuery动画，
But your job is to get rid
of that jQuery animation,

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.050
使用CSS过渡，但是当鼠标进入时，当我们想要添加将改变，
use the CSS transition, but when the mouse
enters, when we wanna add will-change,

58
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.020
当他们点击时，我们想要添加这个类。
when they click,
we want to add this class.

59
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.560
然后当鼠标离开的时候，过渡结束的地方，也就是我们把
And then when the mouse leaves, where the
transition ends, that will be when we put

60
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.969
它回到了自己的层，因为我们是浏览器社区中的好公民。
it back on its own layer because we are
good citizens in the browser community.

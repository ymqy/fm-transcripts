00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.359
>> Brian Holt: 我敢说你永远不会用这个。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I will venture to say
that you will never use this one.

2
00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:03.753
这主要是供图书馆作者使用的。
This is mostly for library authors.

3
00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.048
我只想让你知道它在外面
I just want to let you
know that it's out there.

4
00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:09.644
我告诉过你，数据只流一个，反应是从父母到
I've told you that data only flows one
way, in react it goes from parent to

5
00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:13.131
孩子，然后那个孩子，孩子和孩子，对吧 ?
child, and then that child to that child,
and child to child, right?

6
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:15.362
所以它只会向下移动，不会后退。
So it only moves down,
it doesn't go back up.

7
00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:18.253
这就是你把它翻到它头上的方式
This is how you flip it on it's head.

8
00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:22.687
实际上，您可以让子代控制父代。
You can actually have
a child control the parent.

9
00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:27.295
我这里有西雅图，华盛顿，如果我要删除
So here I have from that I have Seattle,
Washington and if I delete and

10
00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:32.155
单击验证表单，使其成为红色，然后重新聚焦在该表单上，对。
click validate form it'll make that
red and then refocus on it, right.

11
00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:37.575
所以我在这里有一个精心设计的输入，然后我就需要集中精力在这个问题上。
So I have an elaborate input here and then
I need to be able to focus on that right.

12
00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:41.476
这就是父母会做的事对吧
Which is something that
the parent would do, right?

13
00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:45.268
所以这实际上允许孩子向父母展示一个功能
So this is actually allowing the child
to expose a function to the parent so

14
00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:48.479
家长可以说嘿，关注这个，对吧 ?
the parent can say hey,
focus on this, right?

15
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.409
这就是用它来处理的事情。
So that's what this is doing
here with useImperativeHandle.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.509
我在这里不太了解细节因为这只是
I'm not gonna get too much into the weeds
of the details here because it's just

17
00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:59.210
没那么有趣
not that interesting.

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.070
但欢迎您通过此代码进行挖掘
But you're welcome to dig
in through this code and

19
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.219
如果这对你有用的话就更多了
figure out more of what it
does if this is useful to you.

20
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.719
这就是在做什么呢 ?
So what this is doing,
this useImperativeHandle,

21
00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.170
就是把这个功能回归到这个叫做焦点的功能上。
is it's returning this
function here called focus.

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.170
现在家长电话的重点放在这个精心设计的输入上，对吧 ?
And now the parent call focus
on this elaborate input, right?

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.640
然后我用这个向前引用的功能来做
And then I'm doing that with
this forwardRef function,

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.519
基本上是说如果有人对我做了裁判
which is basically saying, hey,
if someone makes a ref on me

25
00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:28.159
我要在这个特定项目上提供功能，对吧 ?
I'm going to make functions available
on this particular item, right?

26
00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.979
所以现在如果我在这里发现我有个城市艾尔和一个国家
So now if I go down here, notice that
I have a cityEl and a stateEl and

27
00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.500
我正在用这俩人的裁判
I'm using ref on both of those.

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.527
然后，如果我在这里，他们在这里有一个国家厄尔尼诺和城市的引用，对吧 ?
And then if I go down in here, they have
a ref here of stateEl, and cityEl, right?

29
00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:46.525
然后我就有了这个验证功能
And then I have here this
validation function which is

30
00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:50.197
我在 Stack Overflow [LAUGH]上发现了它。
law I found it on Stack Overflow [LAUGH].

31
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:52.512
这将验证城市，这将验证状态。
This will validate a city and
this will validate a state.

32
00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:59.639
所以如果这个城市是无效的，对，就会说cityEl.current.焦距，对吧 ?
So if the city is not valid, right, then
it'll say cityEl.current.focus, right?

33
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.701
这个聚焦功能来自这里。
And that focus function came from here.

34
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:06.183
所以，我真的不认为你会写太多这些。
So again, I really don't think you'll
be writing very many of these.

35
00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:08.788
但很多图书馆的作者将会为
But a lot of library authors
will be writing these things for

36
00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:14.176
你， >> Brian Holt: 有道理吗 ?
you,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

37
00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:14.778
同一件事
Same thing here.

38
00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:19.151
如果我将其删除，然后在此处放置 S ，然后单击验证表单。
If I delete this, and you put S here and
then click validate form.

39
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:22.433
它会聚焦在那个上面，让它真正地捕捉到它的焦点。
It'll focus on that one so that it'll
actually capture the focus there.

40
00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:28.550
>> Brian Holt: 这就是你所拥有的所有挂钩。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it,
that is all of the hooks that you have.

41
00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.050
没有更多的了。
There are no more.

42
00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.038
还有一个，但是我觉得他们把它删了，因为它太乱了。
There was like one more, but I think they
deleted it because it was so confusing.

43
00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:37.539
这些都不是令人困惑的。
These are the not confusing ones.

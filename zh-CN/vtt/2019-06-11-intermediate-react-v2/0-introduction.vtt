00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.216
>> Brian Holt: 欢迎使用 Intermediate React V2。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Welcome to
the Intermediate React V2.

2
00:00:02.216 --> 00:00:07.290
我很高兴能在这里跟你谈谈雷法的事
I'm really excited to be here
talking to you about React again.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.364
今天我们要讨论的是延伸的 " 雷法 " 生态系统。
And today we're gonna be talking
about the extended React ecosystem.

4
00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:13.272
>> Brian Holt: 正在重新执行
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: React in and

5
00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:16.925
本身并不是通常用于构建项目的唯一工具。
of itself is not typically the only
tool that you use to build a project.

6
00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:20.768
你会把像E原动议一样的东西带进来
You're gonna bring in things like
Emotion to do CSS, you're gonna do Node

7
00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:25.295
服务器端呈现，您要执行代码分割，以及所有这些内容。
server-side rendering, you're gonna do
code splitting, and all that kinda stuff.

8
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:27.963
所以中间 React 的目的就是要教你
And so that's what intermediate
React aims to teach you,

9
00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.370
是这种扩展的生态系统类型
is these kind of extended
ecosystem type of things.

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.387
所以我要你做的第一件事就是去 bit.ly， B-I-T-L-Y。
So the first thing I want you to
do is go to bit.ly, B-I-T-L-Y.

11
00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:41.176
请使用 Bit.ly，而不是 /reat-v5。
Bit.ly, rather, /react-v5.

12
00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:42.639
这应该带你到这个网站
And that should take you
to this website here.

13
00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:45.659
你也可以把这两个工作都联系起来。
You can also just go to this link
up there as well, those both work.

14
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.380
这是我的课程笔记是吧
These are my course notes, right?

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.229
你看到我在这儿有个表面
So you see that I have a Surface here.

16
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.640
其实我在你面前所看到的，也是我在这里所看到的。
Literally what I have on what you see in
front of you is what I have here as well.

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.079
所以如果你迷路了什么的
So If you get lost or anything like that,

18
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.380
你就能自由地跳进我的笔记里然后再看一下
you can feel free to just jump into my
notes and take a look at that as well.

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.069
所以关于这个网站要注意的事是完整的 " 再行动" 的简介
So, the thing to note about this website
is both the complete the intro to React,

20
00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.242
简介部分在这里，中间部分是。
the intro part is in here,
and the intermediate part is.

21
00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:15.469
因此，引入部分在此处是 1 到 15 。
So, the introduction part
is 1 through 15 here.

22
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.319
因此，结束后的一切都是这一过程的中间部分。
So everything after conclusion is
the intermediate part of this course.

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.185
知道这件事的是我们仍在用同样的项目
The thing to know about this is that
we're still gonna use the same project

24
00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:32.180
从这个课程的第一个版本开始，我们将会增加这个项目。
from the first version of this course,
and we're just going to augment that.

25
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.150
现在你不用做引言了
Now, you don't have to have
taken the introduction,

26
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.680
你要是有就很有帮助但你不用做介绍
it's helpful if you have, but you don't
have to have taken the introduction

27
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.509
来完成这部分课程
to do this part of the course.

28
00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.219
另一件值得注意的是与引言相反
The other thing to note,
as opposed to the introduction,

29
00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.500
每一个都是一个分支，对吧 ?
is each one of these is a branch, right?

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.549
所以每一个都是完全被筛选的。
So each one of these is totally siloed.

31
00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.120
所以如果你想跳过E动议，直接去做代码分割，你可以。
So if you wanna skip Emotion and
go straight to Code Splitting, you can.

32
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.887
所以每一个都在一个不同的仓里。
So each one of these is
totally in a different silo.

33
00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:03.489
作为引言，你可以看到我在这里所拥有的一切。
As by way of introduction,
you can read everything that I have here.

34
00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.760
但只要说我是谁我叫布莱恩 - 霍尔特
But just to say who I am,
my name's Brian Holt.

35
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.612
我在微软工作
I work at Microsoft.

36
00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:13.319
我以前是个云代言人现在我是高级计划经理
I used to be a cloud advocate, and
now I'm a senior program manager

37
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.240
在 Azure 上的 Node.js 以及 Visual Studio 代码。
on Node.js on Azure,
as well as on Visual Studio Code.

38
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.550
我住在西雅图和我的妻子和我的狗
I live in Seattle with my wife and my dog.

39
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.550
我有时在欢乐的时候在前面说话
And I sometimes talk out
in front in happy hour.

40
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.581
我是一个董事会成员
I am a board member for

41
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:29.610
Vet Who Code 以及非洲会议的共同创始人， Concatenate公司。
Vet Who Code as well as a co-founder
of the African conference, Concatenate.

42
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.930
在这里的社交媒体上，我可以自由地与我联系，我也有我的所有联系。
Feel free to catch up with me on social
media here, I have all my links as well.

43
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.629
我一直都是在前线老师教这些东西
And I'm stoked as always to be here at
Frontend Masters teaching the stuff

44
00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.060
我很喜欢教书
that I love to teach.

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.050
我真的很高兴他们鼓励我打开我的材料
And I'm really, really happy that they
encouraged me to open source my materials

46
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.939
这样你就能和同事一起分享这些了
so that you can share these with
your coworkers, and with anyone.

47
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.949
像往常一样，如果你把雷波放在 GitHub 上，这对我很有帮助。
As always, it's really helpful for
me if you star the repo on GitHub so

48
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.370
其他人也能找到这个
that other people can find this as well.

49
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.060
太酷了
Cool.

50
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.212
所以在这里的引言中
So inside of this introduction here,

51
00:03:02.212 --> 00:03:05.723
在上面写着长串的数字和字母
underneath where it says long
series of numbers and letters.

52
00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:10.704
如果您单击此存储库，那么会将您转至 GitHub 存储库
If you click on the repo is here,
this'll take you to the GitHub repo for

53
00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:12.460
这门课
this course.

54
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.830
所以你在这里看到的是完成的
So what you see here in
the masterbranch is the finished

55
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.329
React 项目的完整简介，好吗 ?
a Complete Intro to React project, okay?

56
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.306
这就是它在完成 < 反行为的简介 > 之后的状态。
So this is the state that it's in after
you do the Complete Intro to React.

57
00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:28.771
我们要做的是我们要做的是
What we're going to do for every single
section of this particular course is we're

58
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:33.579
然后再回到主子里然后我们又要重新开始了对吧
gonna go back to the master branch, and
then we're going to start again, right?

59
00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.479
一旦我们完成了E议案，我们就会回到主子部门，
So as soon as we finish Emotion, we're
going to go back to the master branch, and

60
00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.210
然后我们就开始做服务器端渲染或者类似的事情
then we're gonna start on server side
rendering or something like that.

61
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.364
只要你对任何事情都做了就把你的所有属地都清楚
So as soon as you're done with any
section, just clear all your dependencies,

62
00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:45.939
除去节点模块，运行 npm 安装。
remove your node modules, run npm install.

63
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.711
我要提醒你我们正在进行的事情。
And I'll remind you of these
things as we're going along.

64
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:50.957
或者您可以克隆新版本的存储库或
Or you can just clone a new
version of the repo or

65
00:03:50.957 --> 00:03:55.490
你可以打开一个新的分支，这些都是不错的事情。
you can open a new branch,
those are all fine things to do.

66
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.199
但是如果你想看，我在这里就有了全部的工作。
But if you want to see,
I have all of the complete work up here.

67
00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.669
如果您单击此信息，您可以看到代码分割。
If you click on this,
you can see that there's code splitting.

68
00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:01.979
有E议案。
There's Emotion.

69
00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.840
这两个用于 GitHub 页面，这是课程 Web站点。
These two are for the GitHub Pages,
which is the course website.

70
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.639
还有 Redux， SSR，测试和 TypeScript。
And then there's Redux, SSR,
testing, and TypeScript.

71
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.300
这些都在这里
Those are all here as well.

72
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.038
但是，对于每个新部分，您只需返回到干净的主分支。
But again, for each new section,
you just go back to a clean master branch.

73
00:04:14.038 --> 00:04:18.346
你可以考虑使用 Sourcetree之类的东西
You might consider using
something like Sourcetree,

74
00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:21.725
网址是sourcetreeapp.com 。
which you can get at sourcetreeapp.com.

75
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:25.269
如果你不太熟悉它就能帮你了
And this will help you if you're
not super familiar with git.

76
00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:27.262
您还可以使用 GitHub Desktop。
You can also use GitHub Desktop.

77
00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:29.242
我只是用命令行
I just use the command line.

78
00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:33.874
所以你可以自由地使用最适合你的东西
So feel free to use
whatever suits you best.

79
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:38.437
但我建议你把它叫做 " 深度 Git "
But I would suggest you take
's course called Git in Depth.

80
00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.103
Git 绝对是一个值得了解的工具。
Git is definitely a tool
that's worth knowing.

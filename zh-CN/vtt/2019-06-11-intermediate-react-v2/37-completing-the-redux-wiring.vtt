00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.410
>> Brian Holt: 所以我们没有修复另一个页面，对吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we didn't fix the other page, right?

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.076
所以如果我们回到过去， >> Brian Holt: 我们可以
So if we went back over to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We could just go ahead and

3
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.499
做得真快，细节比如，它还从语境里看，
do it really quick, in details such as,
cuz it's also reading from context and

4
00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.019
上下文不再存在。
context no longer exists.

5
00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.469
所以我们会把它删除。
So we would delete that.

6
00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.707
我们将从连接中导入连接。
We would import connect, from connect.

7
00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:30.092
对不起，不是来自连接，而是反应 - redux。
Sorry, not from connect, but react-redux.

8
00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:35.542
> > 布莱恩 - 霍尔特:
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the context stuff down here,

9
00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:39.070
我们会把所有这些东西都删除了
we would delete all of that stuff
cuz we don't need it anymore.

10
00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:45.536
>> Brian Holt: 对吧 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

11
00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:50.640
我们不需要这些疯狂的东西
We don't need this crazy stuff.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.840
这里的主题就是 props.theme。
And theme here is just
gonna be props.theme.

13
00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.021
而道具，实际上，这将会是主题。
And props, well actually,
this is going to be this.props.theme.

14
00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.367
>> Brian Holt: 我认为这是唯一的参考。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's
the only reference to it.

15
00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:11.625
好的
Okay, cool.

16
00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:13.019
现在我们得把它连接起来
And now we just have to go connect it.

17
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:20.789
所以我们要在这里说
So here we're gonna say
const WrappedDetails

18
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:30.780
将等于连接(mapStateToProps) ，然后是 " 详细信息 " 。
is going to be equal to
connect(mapStateToProps) and then Details.

19
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.539
然后我们要把它改为 WrappedDetails
And then we're going to change
this to be WrappedDetails,

20
00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.490
然后我们就得赶紧做正确的地图地图
and then we just have to quickly
right const mapStateToProps.

21
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.890
这就好了
That's gonna be this.

22
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.848
它将会以一个主题
It's going to take on a theme and

23
00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:48.055
它将会返回一个主题在其中的对象。
it's going to return an object
that has theme in it.

24
00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:58.341
>> Brian Holt: 对，因为我们的 redux 商店都有主题
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, because our redux
store has both theme in it as well as

25
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:03.260
位置，但此特定组件不关心位置。
location, but this particular
component doesn't care about location.

26
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.560
所以我们不想注入这个，我们只是想注入一个主题。
So we don't want to inject that,
we just want to inject theme.

27
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.370
这就是为什么我们只有主题和注射
That's why we're only pulling
out theme and injecting that.

28
00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.390
所以现在如果你再回去详细说明
And so now,
if you go back over to details, submit,

29
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.909
去看看胖子斯林
go look at Fat Boy Slim here.

30
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.170
还在读和写 redux ，对吧 ?
Still reading and
writing from redux, right?

31
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.389
所以我只向你展示的一切都是同步的，对吗 ?
So everything I've shown you so
far as purely synchronous, a redux, right?

32
00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.110
我们没有执行任何 Ajax 请求。
We didn't do any Ajax requests.

33
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.340
我们什么都没做
We didn't do anything like that.

34
00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.900
在这个过程中的 V3 或者之前
In V3 of the course,
as well as perhaps before,

35
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.849
我不记得我们之前是否做过这事我们过去
I don't remember if we did it before or
not, we go over redux thunk, which is

36
00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.719
从 API 中获取内容的一种方法，将其返回，将其送入 redux。
one way to do request something from
an API, get it back, feed it into redux.

37
00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.530
你能用雷达克斯完成更复杂的事情
Yeah, there's just more complex things
that you can accomplish with redux.

38
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.689
但现在我觉得这足以证明你是什么
But for now, I think this is enough of
a demonstration to show you what you're

39
00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.729
如果你要重入重地的话就会变成这样
getting into if you if
you're getting into redux.

40
00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:02.961
我们要把它重新设定好
We're gonna do git reset --HARD,

41
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:08.099
或者硬得像这样
or hard like that to HEAD.

42
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:14.568
然后我们就会
And then we're gonna

43
00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:20.319
说 git clean -f.
say git clean -f.

44
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.060
我很难区分 mpm 和
I have a really hard time
distinguishing mpm and

45
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.639
它是三个字母的东西我经常用这两个字母
git cuz they're three letter things and
I use both of them constantly.

46
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.668
我想我得做 rf
I think I have to do rf.

47
00:03:32.668 --> 00:03:33.760
没有吗
No?

48
00:03:40.163 --> 00:03:41.807
>> Brian Holt: 好，随便吧。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, whatever.

49
00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:46.576
我想我还是有的，有的文件夹存在，但是
I think I still have, yeah,
some of these folders exist, but

50
00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:49.531
我们去把他们手动删除吧
let's just go delete them manually.

51
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:50.259
服务器。
Server.

52
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.341
>> Brian Holt: 删除。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Delete.

53
00:03:57.685 --> 00:03:59.591
>> Brian Holt: 和源。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And source.

54
00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.875
>> Brian Holt: 到废纸篓，还原器，移至废纸篓。
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To trash,
reducers, move to trash.

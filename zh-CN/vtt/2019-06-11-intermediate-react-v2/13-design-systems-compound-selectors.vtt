00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.410
> > 布莱恩: 另一个很酷的事情是你可以建立一个设计系统
&gt;&gt; Brian: Another cool thing here is that
you can kind of build design systems

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.069
变成这样
into this.

3
00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.514
所以我想让你做个新文件
So I want you to make a new file and

4
00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:09.419
在源目录中此处调用 colors.css 。
call it colors.css here
in the source directory.

5
00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.029
或者对不起 colors.js，相反
Or sorry, colors.js, rather.

6
00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:20.379
>> Brian: 我希望您在此处仅导出缺省对象。
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I want you to make
just export default object here.

7
00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:24.307
你可以在这里用一些颜色或者类似的颜色，对吧。
And just, you can put in like some colors
here or something like that, right.

8
00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:29.716
因此，我可以说主导出缺省值。
So I could say primary export default.

9
00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:37.887
> > 布莱恩: 我们会说，我有什么， bf3334。
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we'll say like,
what do I have, bf3334.

10
00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:46.310
辅助服务器为 #d9c148。
Secondary is #d9c148.

11
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:54.469
> > 布莱恩: 黑暗是 122622#
&gt;&gt; Brian: Dark is 122622#.

12
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:58.811
>> Brian: 光明。
&gt;&gt; Brian: Light is.

13
00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:07.182
>> Brian: #81a69b。
&gt;&gt; Brian: #81a69b.

14
00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:09.448
所以现在我在一个地方都有这些颜色，对吧 ?
So now I have all these
colors in one place, right?

15
00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:12.965
所以我可以去我的酒吧
So, I can actually come
over to my nav bar.

16
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.513
> > 布莱恩: 你不用完全复制我的颜色。
&gt;&gt; Brian: You don't have
to copy my colors exactly.

17
00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:18.706
如果你想的话你可以把粉色放进去
You could put pink in
there if you want to.

18
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.525
> > 布莱恩: 关键是你可以在这里看到，
&gt;&gt; Brian: The point is
that you can see here,

19
00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:26.420
您可以集中所有设计系统，样式指南或
you could centralize all of your
design system, your style guide, or

20
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.073
不管你想说什么这里就有一个地方
whatever you wanna call it,
here in one place.

21
00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:30.456
现在我可以将它导入到我的代码中。
And now I can import this into my code.

22
00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:37.881
我可以用点颜色说进口颜色对吧
I can say import colors from .colors,
right?

23
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.954
这不是粉红色的背景我可以的
Instead of having pink as
the background here, I can have it be.

24
00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:48.454
>> Brian: colors.primary，对吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian: colors.primary, right?

25
00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:52.445
所以现在如果我到这里，那将会是一个很不错的红色的树荫。
So now if I go over here,
it would be a nice shade of red.

26
00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.623
或者我可以放色彩色的
Or I can put colors.secondary.

27
00:01:57.608 --> 00:01:59.823
>> 布莱恩: 对，现在的东西越来越多了，
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right, and
now stuff is starting to match more,

28
00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:02.052
因为那是这个网站的实际颜色。
because those are the actual
colors of the site.

29
00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:07.861
我还是觉得粉色不错，你问我也行。
I still think the pink was nice,
if you ask me, but this is fine too.

30
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.985
所以，让我们说，我们想在狮子狗上拥有某种悬浮状态。
So, let's say we wanted to have some
sort of hover state on the poodle.

31
00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:16.262
这在这里很容易做到，你只需将鼠标悬停在其中。
That's pretty easy to do here,
you just put &amp;:hover.

32
00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:19.971
这感觉很熟悉你以前就像个混蛋一样
This feels pretty familiar if you've done
like sass before or something like that.

33
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:25.295
然后是文本装饰: 下划线。
And then text-decoration: underline.

34
00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:27.634
所以我们就加了这个
So we just added that.

35
00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:31.627
现在，如果你回来的话
And now, if you come back over here.

36
00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:32.639
我怎么弄坏的
How did I break it?

37
00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.438
太棒了
That's impressive.

38
00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:39.979
不知道我这里是否有个奇怪的状态
I wonder if I got into
a strange state here.

39
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:55.027
> > 布莱恩: 我觉得我的包裹刚刚坏了。
&gt;&gt; Brian: I think my parcel just broke.

40
00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:59.555
好了这样你就可以把它悬停在狗上并强调它
Okay, so that's works now so
you can hover on the dog and underline it.

41
00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:02.000
这就是你喜欢悬浮状态和敌人的方式
That's how you do like hover states and
befores and afters and

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.379
都是那种东西
all that kind of stuff.

43
00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.719
你也可以在下面做儿童选择器，如果你需要的话，对吧 ?
You can also do child selectors underneath
that as well if you needed to, right?

44
00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.782
所以如果我有一个孩子的按钮你就可以
So if I had like a child button,
you could just put,

45
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:15.332
我想你只要按按钮就好了
I think you just put button and
I think it would just work.

46
00:03:15.332 --> 00:03:17.073
立即的儿童选择器，所有这些东西。
And immediate child selector,
all that kind of stuff.

47
00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:21.497
您可以使用和作为实际组件本身的替身。
You can use and as a stand-in for
the actual component itself.

48
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.132
> > 布莱恩: 好吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?

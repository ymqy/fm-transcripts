00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.319
我们来谈谈密码测试
Let's talk about the code tests.

2
00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:07.820
根据公司的不同，密码测试是他们给你的东西。
The code tests is, depending on the
company, is something that they give you.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.186
这可能是一个多小时的项目
It's probably gonna be
a multi hour project,

4
00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:14.476
大概 5 到 10 个小时吧
maybe 5 to 10 hours, somewhere in there.

5
00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:17.056
但他们想知道你是如何在更大的环境中编码的。
But they want to see how you
code in a larger environment.

6
00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:20.960
密码测试是我个人在篱笆上的事
Code tests are something I
personally am on the fence about.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.705
如果某人具有强大的 GitHub 或交付项目的历史，例如，
If someone has a robust GitHub or a
history of delivering projects, like yeah,

8
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.349
你在那个项目上工作好吗
you worked on that project, okay.

9
00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.160
我可以查看他们的 GitHub ，我不能做代码测试。
I can check out their GitHub,
I may not do a code test.

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.649
但有很多公司你会得到一个代码测试。
But there are plenty of companies
you'll get a code test for.

11
00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.429
这里有一些东西，肯定是你想做的一些小费。
Here are some of the things,
certainly some of the tips you want to do.

12
00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.079
第一点，如果你忽略我说的其他内容，请注意。
Tip number one, if you ignore
everything else I say, follow this.

13
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.079
尽可能使您的代码可读。
Make your code as readable as possible.

14
00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.549
别太聪明了
Don't try to be clever.

15
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.820
没人会用双字条代替 math.round 来表扬你
No one's gonna applaud you for
using double tilde instead of math.round.

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.409
是啊看起来很酷你就像是在看我是多么聪明
Yeah, it looks cool and you're like, wow,
look how they're gonna see how smart I am.

17
00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.223
如果你读了很多代码评论你就不会想要聪明
If you're reading through many code
reviews, you're not gonna want cleverness,

18
00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:02.661
您需要阅读代码。
you want readable code.

19
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.051
作为一名工程师如果我在读某人的代码评论
As an engineer,
if I'm reading someone's code review or

20
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:07.825
审查某人的密码测试我想看看他们是否知道密码
reviewing someone's code test I
want to see do they know the code.

21
00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:11.757
这是一种代码，我想知道我是否加入了自己的代码库。
It's this type of code I want to see
if I come up in my code base itself.

22
00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:13.721
这些都是我要检讨的政策。
These are the kind of
PRs I want to review.

23
00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:19.469
就这样，别聪明了，只要把它弄明白就好了。
That's it, don't be clever,
just get it done and make it readable.

24
00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.829
并对您的代码进行注释。
And comment your code.

25
00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.859
直到我死的那天我会说你的代码
Until the day I die,
I'm gonna say comment your code.

26
00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.650
有趣的是，不是每个人都同意我这样做。
Funny enough,
not everybody agrees with me on this.

27
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.519
有人说，代码应该是自记录的。
Some people say,
code should be self-documenting.

28
00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:30.829
人们都这么说
People say that all the time.

29
00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.039
酷，让它自我记录，但也要评论你的代码，就是它。
Cool, make it self-documenting, but
also comment your code, that's it.

30
00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.509
特别是如果你读了很多密码测试
Especially if you're reading
a lot of code tests.

31
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.310
对您的代码进行注释，使其更易于理解。
Comment you code,
it makes it easier to understand.

32
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.340
好吧，我不同意他们做事的方式，但是
Okay, I don't necessarily agree with
the way they're doing things, but

33
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.210
我遵循他们的逻辑
I follow their logic.

34
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.134
因为他们告诉我他们在干什么
Because they told me
what they're doing and

35
00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:46.120
我不需要花时间来解决这个问题。
I don't have to take
time to figure that out.

36
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.558
因为如果我得花时间弄明白我大概会喜欢
Because if I have to take time to
figure it out, I'll probably be like,

37
00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.579
这太复杂了
this is too complicated, next.

38
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.479
这就是它的发展。
That's just how it goes.

39
00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.067
你是个忙碌的人我是个忙碌的人
You're a busy person, I'm a busy person.

40
00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:58.640
只需让您的代码可读，并对其进行注释并不要使其复杂化。
Just make your code readable, and
comment it and don't over complicate it.

41
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.549
试图像我说的那样很有诱惑力
It's tempting to try to be like I said,
clever.

42
00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.200
简单的说，最好的代码是最简单的代码。
Just make it simple,
the best code is the simplest code.

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.319
最佳代码实际上是最小的代码量。
The best code is actually
the least amount of code.

44
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.217
如果有人打了什么就有 6 个不同的功能
If someone blows up something and
it's six different functions, and

45
00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:13.536
不需要这么做会使它变得更加复杂
it doesn't need to be,
that's overcomplicating it.

46
00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:16.770
保持干净，让它可读，不要让它太狂野。
Keep it clean, keep it readable,
don't make it too wild.

47
00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.599
不要导入太多的库。
Don't import too many libraries.

48
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.331
图书馆不告诉我你知道什么
Libraries don't tell me what you know.

49
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:23.350
他们告诉我你知道如何去谷歌
They tell me that you know
how to Google things or

50
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.400
你知道怎么用别人知道的东西
you know how to use
what other people know.

51
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.460
这也是一种技能，但是
Which is a skill too, but

52
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.603
在这个特别的测试中我想知道你在干什么吗
in this particular test I'm trying to
see do you know what you're doing?

53
00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:31.210
你知道怎么编码吗
Do you know how to code?

54
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.389
在这里导入一个库就可以了
It's okay to import a library here and

55
00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.319
就在那里，这取决于那些给出密码测试的人是什么。
there, depending on what the people
who is giving the code test are.

56
00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.509
有人说没有图书馆，有人说为所欲为。
Some people say no library,
some people say do whatever you want.

57
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:41.699
但即使他们说你可以使用 React 或 Angular ， Vue 或 Vue
But even if they say you can use React or
Angular or Vue or

58
00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.370
不管你想要什么我都不会去进口图书馆
whatever you want, I wouldn't go
overboard on importing libraries.

59
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.900
最好尽量把它保持简单
It's better to keep it
as simple as possible.

60
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.961
我一般都坚持 " 洛达什 " ，只是实用功能。
I generally stick to Lodash,
just utility functions.

61
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:56.030
我可以编这些实用程序但很不错是有人为我做的
I could code up these utility functions,
but it's nice that someone did it for me.

62
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.629
但他们不会作弊的
But they're not cheating anyway.

63
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.849
如果您在末尾有任何时间作为顶部的樱桃，请添加某些单元测试。
If you have any time at the end,
as a cherry on top, add some unit tests.

64
00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.145
这个人是一个圆形的工程师。
This person is a well rounded engineer.

65
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.564
他们不只是想把工作做了
They don't just think about
getting the job done,

66
00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:08.740
他们会想到可维护性
they think about maintainability.

67
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.707
他们会思考这个代码是如何在一段时间里生存的。
They think about how this
code is gonna live over time.

68
00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:14.278
如果您对代码测试有任何疑问，请询问问题。
And if you have any questions
on the code test, ask questions.

69
00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.199
我知道，如果你有问题，问问题，但你经常不问。
I know, if you have questions,
ask questions, but you often don't.

70
00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.639
可以免费向该人员发送邮件并进行说明。
Feel free to email that person back and
say.

71
00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.509
哎，我有个问题，我不太了解要求，
Hey, I have a question on, I don't
really understand the requirements,

72
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.379
或者这对我来说是不清楚的问问题
or this is unclear to me, ask questions.

73
00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.420
你最好提前问问题你别傻了
It's better to ask questions ahead
of time, you won't look silly.

74
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.253
不做密码测试也是完全错误的
Than to do the code test and
it's completely wrong.

75
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:35.689
他们就像这样我们最好让你重做
And they're like, well,
at best we're gonna ask you to redo it.

76
00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.793
在最坏的情况下他们会后悔的，不，下一个
At worst they're gonna be like sorry,
no, next.

77
00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:42.313
你浪费了你的时间浪费了他们的时间
And you wasted your time,
you wasted their time.

78
00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:43.259
所以请提前提问。
So ask questions ahead of time.

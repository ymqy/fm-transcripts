1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.573
好了现在是时候了我要卷起老袖子了
All right, so now it's the time,
I'm gonna roll up the old sleeves.

2
00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:09.519
现实地，从比喻上说，不管你想要什么都可以。
Realistically, metaphorically,
proverbially, whatever you want.

3
00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.619
我建议，在此部分，我建议关闭您的笔记本电脑。
I recommend, at this portion,
I recommend, close your laptops.

4
00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.349
太诱惑人了
It's too tempting to look stuff up.

5
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.086
在一个真正的采访中，你不能去谷歌，你不能把手机拿出来。
In a real interview, you can't go on
Google, you can't pull out your phone.

6
00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:25.399
我推荐一张纸和笔，旧的学校或白板，如果你有的话。
I recommend a piece of paper and a pen,
old school or whiteboard, if you have one.

7
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.870
如果你在教室里和一群人一起工作
If you're watching this at your work
with a bunch of people in a classroom,

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.829
白板也很好
a whiteboard is good too.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.039
但实践它喜欢的代码。
But practice what it's like to code.

10
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.286
只是精神上，完全不使用电脑。
Just mentally,
not using a computer at all.

11
00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:39.270
这里没有画家这里没有帮手
There's no linters,
there's no helpers here.

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.609
我真的觉得如果你这么做
And I really think if you do these,

13
00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.490
你会更了解我们在这里解决的问题
you'll understand much stronger about
the problems we're gonna solve here.

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.353
好吧为了这个挑战
All right, so for this challenge,

15
00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:51.466
我希望您创建一个函数来反转字符串。
I want you to create a function
to reverse a string.

16
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.064
我甚至给了你一些，我甚至给你提供了一些样本输出。
I even gave you some, I even helpfully
gave you some sample output here.

17
00:00:55.064 --> 00:00:59.740
我不想说这是一个热身的问题，但这是一个热身的问题。
I don't wanna say it's a warm up question,
but it is kind of warm up question.

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.014
如果你有麻烦的话没关系
If you had a little trouble, that's okay.

19
00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:06.189
我们将在没有电脑的情况下使用代码。
We're going to get used to the coding
without our computers for a bit.

20
00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:06.780
我当然了
I of course,

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.185
我要用我的电脑，因为如果我把它写出来，你可以读我的书。
I'm gonna use my computer because you
can read my writing if I wrote it out.

22
00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:14.343
我被告知我不允许用白板是因为我的笔迹
And I was told I'm not allowed to use
a whiteboard because my handwriting is

23
00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:15.469
很残暴
atrocious.

24
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.140
所以我要在这里编码但我不打算把它给跑了
So I'm just gonna code it here but
I'm not gonna run it.

25
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.081
对于这一特殊功能，我希望它是正确的。
For this particular function I
want it to be actually correct.

26
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.265
我接下来要问的很多问题
A lot of the questions
I'm gonna ask later,

27
00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.992
如果你到球场去我觉得挺好的
if you get in the ball park
I think that's pretty good.

28
00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:30.825
采访者能得到一个好的概念就足以让他们明白
It's enough for the interviewer to get a
good concept of like they understand what

29
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:31.697
你在说什么
you're talking about.

30
00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:35.009
您可能缺少括号或分号，这不重要。
You might be missing a bracket or
a semicolon, it doesn't matter.

31
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.841
虽然这只
For this one, though,

32
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:39.299
我想用很多方法来把它弄明白
I would wanna get it pretty accurate
since there's many ways to do it.

33
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.740
我不会说这是错误的
And I won't say there's a wrong way,

34
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.629
但有更有效的方法去做
but there are more efficient
ways to do it than others.

35
00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:48.216
所以我要用一个 Jem 的小费
So for this one,
I'm gonna say use a Jem tip,

36
00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:53.400
这就是我们想要的
which is talk outs what we want.

37
00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:01.563
所以我想要一个功能，我要把它叫做逆向 cuz ，就是他们所称的。
So I want a function, and I'm gonna call
it reverse cuz that's what they called it.

38
00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:03.909
我知道这个功能会带一个绳子
And I know that function's
gonna take a string.

39
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.810
很酷这才是个好开始
Cool, this is a good starting place.

40
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.680
如果你被困住了就跟你说你想要什么
If you ever get stuck,
just talk out what you want.

41
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.120
如果他们想要一个能让它后来被调用的功能
If they want a function that
it's gonna be later invoked,

42
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.713
您知道需要一个返回另一个函数的函数。
you know you want a function
that returns another function.

43
00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:18.772
然后说出去
And by talking that out and

44
00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.289
得到这个结构真的能帮你精神上的了解
getting the structure really
helps you mentally picture it.

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.750
所以我想反转一个字符串，有几种方法可以做到这一点。
So I want to reverse a string,
there's a few ways to do this.

46
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.990
我要用我能想到的最短的时间来做这个
I'm gonna do this in the shortest
way that I can think of.

47
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.016
因此，我希望返回一个字符串。
So I want to return a string.

48
00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:34.250
但我不会再创造一个新的了
But I'm not going to create a new one yet.

49
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.639
我要做的就是把那串分开
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna split that string.

50
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.009
分割，它执行的是字符串，将其分解为数组。
Split, what that does is it takes
the string, breaks it into an array.

51
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.439
现在我可以用相反的方式
And now I can use reverse.

52
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.754
我知道有些人就像我在一个循环里
I know, some of you are like I
reverse iterated over a loop and

53
00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.356
那我就一起回去
then I'm gonna join it back together.

54
00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.066
正反转一个字符串。
And that is reversing a string.

55
00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:03.150
再次，您可以使用 for 循环。
Again, you could use a for loop.

56
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.973
您可以进入数组，使用 for 循环，然后向后迭代
You could break into an array, use a for
loop, and iterate over it backwards and

57
00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:06.493
那就回去吧
return that.

58
00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:09.069
这也会起作用，这就是我们在这里所做的。
That would also work,
this is essentially what we're doing here.

59
00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.280
这只是用在实用程序中为我们做的。
This is just using those built in
utility methods to do it for us.

60
00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.400
好吧没那么糟吧
All right, not too bad, yes?

61
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.139
> > 这样问采访者是个好地方，对吧 ?
&gt;&gt; So this would be a good place to
ask the interviewer a question, right?

62
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.405
我能用倒转吗
May I use reverse?

63
00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:23.810
[ LAUGH] >> 是，是。
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.069
一般来说这些和大多数访谈都是
Generally for these and
for most interviews,

65
00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.400
除非他们明确表示不要做什么
unless they explicitly
say don't do something.

66
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.276
在这两个问题上，我会要求你编码。
And in about two questions there
will be something I ask you to code.

67
00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.414
我说，别用这个方法，它会为你做。
And I'll say, don't use this
method cuz it'll do it for you.

68
00:03:36.414 --> 00:03:38.240
但我想看看你是怎么想的
But this is something I
want to see how you think.

69
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.729
一般我觉得你可以用什么工具
Generally I think you're fine
to use whatever tools you can.

70
00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.962
再一次，你是白板编码的大部分时间。
Cuz again, you're whiteboard
coding these most of the time.

71
00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:46.216
好吧那就好了
All right, so that was good,

72
00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:49.240
我知道你们中有些人可能有点用纸张上的编码来挣扎
I know some of you probably struggled
a little bit with coding on paper.

73
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.525
这有点奇怪，但这才是真正的访谈。
It's a little weird, but
this is how a real interview would go.

74
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:54.170
能锻炼肌肉就好了
It's good to get those muscles going.

75
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.240
但一般来说，我常说，如果可能的话，请使用数组。
But in general, I always say,
use an array if possible.

76
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.530
阵列是我最喜欢的数据结构之一。
Array is one of my
favorite data structures.

77
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.310
你可以用数组方法来做任何事情。
You can do pretty much anything
you wanna do with array methods.

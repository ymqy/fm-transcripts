1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.309
欢迎您采访前端工程师。
Welcome to interviewing for
front end engineers.

2
00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.940
我选择了漫画漫画，因为这通常是采访的内容。
I chose Comic Sans because that's
what interviews often are.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.140
他们太傻了他们是任意的
They're kind of silly, they're arbitrary.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.253
没有一套你去接受采访的标准或规则和惯例
There's no set of standards or rules and
practices that you walk to an interview,

5
00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.161
你说我知道接下来会发生什么
you say I know exactly
what is gonna happen,

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.047
或者我知道他们要问的问题的类型
or I know exactly the type of
questions they're gonna ask.

7
00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:22.989
不是随机的
No, it's random.

8
00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.940
有多少乒乓球能装在校车上 ?
How many ping pong balls
can fit on a school bus?

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.690
是啊我们都被问到这样的奇怪问题了
Yeah, we've all been asked
weird questions like that.

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.129
有些人在外面冻伤了一分钟
Some of you out there froze up for
a minute.

11
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.039
你就像，十个乒乓球，不，有二十个人。
You're like, ten ping pong,
no, there's 20 people.

12
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.270
这不是真正的问题
Not a real question.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.750
别担心我不会问这类的问题的
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ask any of
those sort of kinda trivia questions.

14
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.694
我真正想的是解决这个问题
What I really wanna get to is solving this
problem of arbitrary questions during

15
00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:47.332
前端面试。
front end interviewing.

16
00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:51.215
或者走进采访不知道会发生什么
Or walking into an interview and
not knowing what's gonna happen,

17
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:52.381
这些步骤是什么
what the steps are.

18
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.719
特别是那些从未访问过的人
Especially people who have never
interviewed, particularly for

19
00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.070
一个前端的角色你不知道该期望什么
a front end role,
you don't know what to expect.

20
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.020
我们今天要把所有这些都包括在内
We're gonna cover all of that today.

21
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.198
但是我想建立的是一个关于前面谈应该如何进行的
But really, what I wanna set up is a
rubric of how front end interviews should

22
00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:08.439
你应该问的问题的类型
go, the type of questions
you should be asking.

23
00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.090
听起来不错吧
Sound good?

24
00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:17.129
好，我叫杰姆 - 扬，我是高级软件工程师。
All right, my name is Jem Young,
I am a senior software engineer.

25
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:22.379
让我们看看我的超级英雄出身
Let's see,
my superhero origin story would be

26
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.900
好奇心是我作为一个工程师出生的方式。
curiosity was how I was
born as an engineer.

27
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.370
星图是我孵化的地方
Startups were where I was incubated.

28
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.030
过去四年里的 Netflix 是我的锻压
Netflix for the past four years,
been my forge.

29
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.849
但教书是我的石
But teaching is my whetstone.

30
00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.421
让我锐利 库兹你在一份工作上花的时间太长了
Keeps me sharp.
Cuz you spend too long at one job,

31
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:42.719
你总是很擅长一件事
you tend to get really good at one thing.

32
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.329
所以我喜欢出去教书，尽量帮别人。
So I like to go out and teach and
try to help others as best I can.

33
00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.963
而且几乎我教过的每一个课程
And also,
almost every course I've ever taught,

34
00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:51.933
我也从你们那里学到了些东西
I learned something from you all too.

35
00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:58.033
但真的，我为什么要教这个课程，我就可以去做了。
But really, why I wanna teach this
course is so I can go on rants.

36
00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.759
我喜欢 rants，我在播客的播客节目中有很多 rants 。
I love rants, I got on a lot of rants on
the podcast I'm on, Front End Happy Hour.

37
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.799
当我们喝饮料的时候，我们谈论的是前端的东西，而且非常好。
Where we have drinks, we talk about
front end things, and it's pretty good.

38
00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.060
但是，这只是一个平台，让我了解事情的发展。
But again, it's just a platform for
me going on rants about things.

39
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.150
我真正想去采访的是采访，因为我有
And what I really wanna go on rants
on is interviewing, because I have so

40
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.030
很多很好的面试 rants
many good interview rants.

41
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.530
别担心这就来了
Don't worry, that's coming.

42
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.049
会很精彩的
It's gonna be very exciting.

43
00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:26.126
所以我想问大家的第一项问题是你没大声说出来
So the first question I wanna ask
everybody, and you don't say it out loud,

44
00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:29.478
想想，为什么采访这么困难?
just think,
why is interviewing so difficult?

45
00:02:31.076 --> 00:02:31.609
怎么了
Yes?

46
00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.170
> > 大部分都适合双方。
&gt;&gt; It's mostly about fit for both parties.

47
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.024
因此，即使你有能力，也未必是一个好的配合。
So even if you have the skills,
it might not be a good fit.

48
00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.078
> > 嗯，那是真的。
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

49
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.608
但让我们再做点更广泛的工作。
Let's go a little broader, though.

50
00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:45.108
有点大
Little broader.

51
00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:51.400
>> 你真的不知道应该会有什么样的问题。
&gt;&gt; You don't really know what to expect
what type of questions are gonna be there.

52
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.240
看来每个公司都有自己的标准
And it seems like every company
has their own standards,

53
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.069
所以你不知道该怎么做
so you don't really know
how to prepare for it.

54
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.783
> > 嗯我喜欢那个
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that one.

55
00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:08.860
我认为这更准确地说明了为什么采访的难度如此之大。
I think that's a bit more accurate on
why interviewing is just so difficult.

56
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.319
因为我们对工程的概念都有不同的想法。
Because we all have this different
idea about what engineering is.

57
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.800
因此，我们对工程应该是什么样的想法都有不同的想法。
Thus, we all these different idea
about what engineering should be.

58
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.150
老实说，我们都是工程师的一种不诚实的观点。
And we all have, honestly, kind of a
dishonest view of ourselves as engineers.

59
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.800
我们有这样的想法，就是我们如何构建事物，以及如何解决问题。
We have this idea of how we build
things and how we solve problems.

60
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.829
我们尝试向其他人申请这个卢布，但我们都不一样。
And we try to apply that rubric to
everybody else, but we're all different.

61
00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.615
这让我们都很美丽，我们都有点不同。
That's what makes us all beautiful
is we're all a little bit different.

62
00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:36.365
这就是为什么你不能真正走进去说有几个 SAT 面试
And that's why you can't really just walk
in and say there's the SATs of interviews,

63
00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:37.742
或者类似的东西
or something like that.

64
00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:41.105
因为我们都有一点点细微的细微差别
Because we all have just a little bit
of nuances that make us a little bit

65
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:41.735
不一样
different.

66
00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:46.521
但最后我想知道为什么采访是如此的
But at the end of the day,
I like to think why interviewing is so

67
00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:49.396
因为我们都不一样
difficult is because we're
all a little different and

68
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:53.100
因为我们对工程的看法有不同的看法
because we all think a little
differently about what engineering is.

69
00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.539
这就使它具有挑战性。
That makes it challenging.

70
00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.289
所以再把这个打破一点，我那天看了这个伟大的博客，
So to break that down a little bit more,
I read this great blog post the other day,

71
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.070
我鼓励你在某个时候读
and I encourage you to
read it at some point.

72
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.336
但这个人把它砸坏了
But this person, they broke it down and

73
00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:12.342
他们说基本上有三种不同类型的工程师。
they said there is essentially
three different types of engineers.

74
00:04:12.342 --> 00:04:17.040
有工程师说工程只是数学。
There are the engineers who
say engineering is just math.

75
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.985
所有关于算法都是关于效率的
It's all about the algorithm,
it's all about efficiency,

76
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:23.002
都是关于聪明的密码和操纵号码的
it's all about clever code and
manipulating numbers around.

77
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:25.533
在这一天的最后，我们正在做的是，我们正在翻转开关，
Cuz at the end of the day, that's what
we're doing, we're flipping switches,

78
00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:26.057
0 和 1 。
ones and zeros.

79
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:31.136
这就是工程的全部，算法，它的美丽。
And that's what engineering is all about,
the algorithms, the beauty of it all.

80
00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:38.319
是啊，而且很多时候，这就是为什么我们在访谈中有很多算法问题。
Yeah, and often, that's why we get a lot
of algorithm questions in interviews.

81
00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.550
有人想说这个人像数学家吗 ?
People are trying to say does this
person think like a mathematician?

82
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.730
这个人认为算法吗 ?
Does this person think in algorithms?

83
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.951
他们看着一个问题说 " 双排 "
Do they look at a problem and
say Double sort,

84
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.875
嗯，那是一个很好的现在申请的算法。
yes, that is a great
algorithm to apply right now.

85
00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:59.060
另一类程序员是编程，是关于硬件性能的。
Another type of programmer is programming
is all about hardware performance.

86
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.040
这都是关于低级别的比特流，接近金属的程度，你能理解吗 ?
It's all about that low level bit-lipping,
how close to the metal, do you understand?

87
00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:08.682
有人认识这样的人吗 ?
Anybody know anybody like that,
the hardware people?

88
00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:10.706
他们是不同的人
They're a different bunch.

89
00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:13.730
他们也很棒 有这种类型的人
They're good, too.
There's those type of people.

90
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.569
他们是黑客和工匠
They're the hackers, the tinkerers.

91
00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.720
可能是在集会上写的
Probably writing in assembly.

92
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.209
您是否了解 CP 注册是什么 ?
Trying to understand do you
understand what a CP register is?

93
00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:24.706
了解 L1 高速缓存与二级高速缓存的对比吗 ?
Do you understand what the L1
cache is versus the L2 cache?

94
00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:25.795
性能问题。
Performance questions.

95
00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:26.992
那个低级的基本知识
That low-level base knowledge.

96
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:31.220
你会得到这样的面试问题，那是非常低级的事情。
You get interview questions like that,
that really low level stuff.

97
00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:37.721
还有第三类工程师，工兵，建筑工人，
And then, there's the third category of
engineers, the tinkerers, the builders,

98
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.480
但是你想描述的是大多数人坐的地方
however you wanna describe them,
that's where most people sit.

99
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.814
在我们理想的世界里，我们就像，我都是关于表演的。
In our ideal world, we're like,
I'm all about performance.

100
00:05:44.814 --> 00:05:48.259
或者我是一个数学的人，这就是我所做的。
Or I'm a math person, that's all I do.

101
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.879
但如果你是一个前端工程师，一般来说，你是在建造东西。
But if you're a front end engineer,
generally, you're building things.

102
00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.459
这就是与人交谈的问题
That's about talking to people,

103
00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:00.100
了解规范，了解不同的浏览器兼容性。
understanding specs, understanding
different browser compatibilities.

104
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.970
所有这些边缘病例
All these edge cases,

105
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.899
所有我们不认为是工程的事情比如会议
all the things that we don't think
of as engineering, like meetings or

106
00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:11.139
有效地传达了你的想法那就是第三类人
efficiently communicating your ideas,
that's the third category of people.

107
00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.613
这就是我们大多数人撒谎的地方。
And that's where most of us lie.

108
00:06:14.052 --> 00:06:16.600
但大多数采访都不是这样的。
But most interviews
aren't like that at all.

109
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.490
你不接受采访的人说
There's no interview
where you walk in you say

110
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.300
嘿有个座位这个是我们的设计师
hey, have a seat, this is our designer.

111
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.600
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

112
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.149
这是我们的产品经理。
This is our product manager.

113
00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:29.759
我们今天要去做一个产品
And we're gonna walk through
building a product today.

114
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.670
所以我们要把它规范出来
So we're gonna spec it out.

115
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.110
你和其他工程师碰面了
Gonna have you meet other engineers, and

116
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.060
我们会让你在一天结束前建造一个产品
we're gonna have you build
a product by the end of the day.

117
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.480
这将更接近我们在现实生活中所做的事情。
That would be closer to what
we do in the real life.

118
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.350
但这并不是发生的事情。
But that's not what happens at all.

119
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.000
所以很多与采访的脱节来自于
So a lot of the disconnect with
interviewing comes from this idea of

120
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.300
我们不知道我们是什么样的工程师
we don't know what type
of engineers we are.

121
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.848
我们不知道我们想要雇用的工程师的类型。
And we don't know what type
of engineers we wanna hire.

122
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:53.069
这只是我的意见。
This is just my opinion.

123
00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.120
采访有很多问题，
There are many problems with interviewing,

124
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.829
但我觉得很多是我们不了解自己的
but I think a lot of it comes from
we don't understand ourselves.

125
00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:00.079
我们不明白什么是工程。
We don't understand what engineering is.

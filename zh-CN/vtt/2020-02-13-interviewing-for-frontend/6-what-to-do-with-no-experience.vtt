1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.000
所以这是一个我经常得到的问题。
So this is a question I get a lot.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.820
我在推特上或在人们谈论和快乐的时候都能得到一个顿号
I get a ton on Twitter or
people talking about and happy hour.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.955
他们说如果我没有经验，怎么办 ?
They say what do I do if I
have little to no experience?

4
00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:13.897
你有什么建议
Now, what would you recommend?

5
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:18.132
我们都是从某个地方开始的
We all started somewhere.

6
00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:19.432
这是我们共同分享的一件事。
That is one thing we all share.

7
00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:20.914
我们都是从某个地方开始的
We all started somewhere.

8
00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:23.038
你是怎么在第一个工作的门口找到你的脚的
How did you get your foot in
the door at the first job?

9
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:26.574
任何人，这是一个公开的问题。
Anybody, this is an open question.

10
00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:27.318
是吗 ?
Yeah?

11
00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:30.564
>> I 已应用于 QA 位置。
&gt;&gt; I applied to a QA position.

12
00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:34.770
然后我就把我的方式变成了一个发展的位置。
And then I kind of worked my way
into more of a development position.

13
00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.500
那是我的工作
That worked for me.

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.509
> > 这条路很棒
&gt;&gt; That's a great path.

15
00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.740
我甚至都没考虑过
I didn't even think of that, yeah.

16
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.281
如果您在 UI 中没有经验，是否有人会将您作为 UI 工程师?
If you have no experience in UI,
is someone gonna you as a UI engineer?

17
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.670
也许吧也许吧
Maybe, maybe.

18
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.234
但另一种方法是应用不同的角色和
But is another way of just applying for
a different role and

19
00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:52.289
你会怎么做呢
then working your way into that?

20
00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.219
那是一个非常有效的角色。
That's a very effective role.

21
00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.469
我见过人们自己做的
I've seen people do it themselves.

22
00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.929
从办公经理到 QA 销售到 QA 工程师。
Move from office manager
to sales to QA to engineer.

23
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.287
为什么不呢 获得新工作的最简单方法是
Why not?
The easiest way to get a new job is to

24
00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:06.659
留在你的公司继续走着去或者上下移动
stay at your same company, just keep
moving sideways, or move up or down,

25
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.585
不管你想要什么
wherever you want.

26
00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:08.168
真是太棒了
That's a great tip.

27
00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.102
怎么了
Yes?

28
00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:14.358
>> 在早期我就知道每个人都会利用我
&gt;&gt; In the early days, I just knew
everybody was gonna take advantage of me,

29
00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:19.271
所以我就建了一堆地方给当地企业，就像
so I just built a bunch of sites for
local businesses and just like for

30
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:20.495
在成本方面的方式。
way under cost.

31
00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:24.618
但是，未来的人们不知道那些人付出了多少。
But then, the future people didn't
know how much those people paid.

32
00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:29.245
所以我要给他们一个更公平的价钱
So I would charge them a more fair
price and every time getting money for

33
00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:31.390
下一个项目。
the next project.

34
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.099
>> 那就好了 > > 刚开始就开始了
&gt;&gt; That's a good-
&gt;&gt; I started with just getting

35
00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.034
利用。
taken advantage of.

36
00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:37.752
>> [LAUGH] >> 但最终仅收费
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But then, eventually just charged

37
00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:41.593
更高更高的价格直到我得到真正的报酬
higher and higher prices until
I was getting really good pay.

38
00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:45.522
>> 你们俩有我还没有想到的建议。
&gt;&gt; You two have suggestions
I didn't even think of yet.

39
00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.164
是的开始在那边自由了
Yes, start out freelancing on the side.

40
00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:51.281
低税率有人会雇你
Charge low rates, someone will hire you.

41
00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.075
我会说一个关于自由职业的警告
I'll say a warning about freelancing.

42
00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:56.323
不像你想的那么迷人
It's not as glamorous as you may think.

43
00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:59.996
你就像我很酷的代码我每天都能制造新的东西
You're like I do cool code and
I get to build something new every day and

44
00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.248
人们为此付出代价
people pay me for that.

45
00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:04.614
不像任何有自由舞的人都会告诉你
No, as anybody who has
freelanced will tell you,

46
00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.269
这不一定是很愉快的
it's not necessarily that pleasant.

47
00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:08.370
但如果你找到合适的人
But if you find the right person,

48
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.949
正确的客户你可以一起工作
the right client,
you can really work together.

49
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.716
如果他们说这个人是个好工程师
And if they say this person's
a good engineer, you're like well,

50
00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:16.338
我在找工作
I'm looking for steady work.

51
00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:17.413
你被雇用了
You're hired.

52
00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:20.645
我们不需要采访你我们见过你所做的工作
We don't have to interview you cuz
we've seen the work you have done.

53
00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:22.235
这条路要走的路很棒
That's a great path to getting in if

54
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.064
你没有那么多专业经验
you don't have that much
professional experience.

55
00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:25.677
> > 它主要是一个结束的手段。
&gt;&gt; It's s mostly a means to an end.

56
00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:28.485
> 嗯，这就是一个很好的例子。
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great example.

57
00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:30.865
有什么建议吗
Any any other suggestions?

58
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:31.930
这些都很好
These are good.

59
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.240
这些都是我一直想知道的问题。
These are questions that
I get all the time.

60
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.478
这些都是很有帮助的。
So these are really helpful.

61
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:42.425
我知道很多人说你应该有一个强大的 GitHub ，有一大堆的例子。
I know a lot of people say you should have
a robust GitHub with a ton of examples.

62
00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:45.788
你应该去
Yeah, you should.

63
00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.728
但这不会让你被人发现的
But that's not gonna help
you get noticed by anybody.

64
00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:53.915
你可能觉得人在不停地拖 GitHub for wow，这个人的
You may think people are constantly
trolling GitHub for wow, this person's so

65
00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:58.530
smart ，查看他们实施的算法，或者这是一个很酷的 UI。
smart, look at this algorithm they
implemented, or this is a really cool UI.

66
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.439
也许没那么多
Probably not as much.

67
00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.430
我推荐的是 GitHub
What I recommend is, yeah, have a GitHub,

68
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.560
有一些东西显示你可以编码，并且展示你的编码风格。
have something on there that shows you
can code, and shows your style of coding.

69
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.284
然后，加入 Twitter。
And then, join Twitter.

70
00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:11.373
把你做的事都公布出来
Post out some of the things you do.

71
00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:15.039
把它写在代码笔里，说我的这个动画让我很酷。
Post it in a code pen and say here's
this animation of me doing cool stuff.

72
00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.329
我不能保证你会给你一份工作但你会注意到的
I can't guarantee you that's gonna land
you a job, but it'll get you noticed.

73
00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.079
我要说的另一件事就是你要做的就是
Another thing I'd say is what
you absolutely have to do is you

74
00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:22.602
必须网络。
have to network.

75
00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.530
我知道我知道
I know.

76
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.722
我上大学的时候我很聪明我有个 CS 学位
When I was in college, I'm like,
I'm so smart, I got a CS degree,

77
00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:29.123
所有人都要雇用我
everybody's gonna hire me.

78
00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:30.432
然后什么也没做
And then nothing.

79
00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:32.252
因为我是谁
Because who was I?

80
00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:33.551
我只是另一个大学毕业生
I was just another college graduate.

81
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.789
但我做的是我交了朋友
But what I did was, I made friends.

82
00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.896
我的第一份工作是我室友因为他在启动时有职位
I got my first job via my roommate
because he had a position at the startup

83
00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:40.521
他当时在
he was at.

84
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.997
他就像在找一个兼职的人
And he's like hey, they're looking for
a junior part-time person.

85
00:03:43.997 --> 00:03:46.604
他们是否利用我薪水很低的优势
And were they taking advantage
of me with very low pay?

86
00:03:46.604 --> 00:03:47.524
可能吧
Probably.

87
00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:48.626
但我在乎吗
But did I care?

88
00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:51.375
不它让我体验了它让我在门口
No, it got me experience,
it got me in the door, and

89
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:54.449
我的简历里有我可以告诉人们的东西
it got something on my resume
that I can tell people about.

90
00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.399
那是另一个吉姆的小费
And that's another Jim tip.

91
00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:00.270
别在第一份工作上找围栏
Don't swing for
the fences on the first job.

92
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.740
你没有经验
You have no experiences.

93
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.445
您可能已在 Google 或 LinkedIn 或
You may have heard people at Google or
LinkedIn or

94
00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:09.673
FrontendMasters 每年支付 200，000 美元，或作为前端工程师。
FrontendMasters getting paid $200,000 a
year or something as front end engineers.

95
00:04:09.673 --> 00:04:11.330
这不会是你第一次出去
That's not gonna be your first time out.

96
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.270
除非你真的很出色真的很幸运
Unless you are truly exceptional and
get really, really, really lucky.

97
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.459
你开始时可能要付很低的工资
You're probably gonna take a pretty
low pay when you start off.

98
00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.100
这只是没有经验的性质。
That's just the nature
of having no experience.

99
00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:26.204
但确保你利用身边的人
But make sure you take advantage
of the people around you.

100
00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:28.158
利用时间来学习。
Leverage the time to learn.

101
00:04:28.158 --> 00:04:31.490
利用所有知识和一切可以从工作中获得的东西。
Leverage all the knowledge and
things you can get out of this job.

102
00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:33.689
怎么了
Yes?

103
00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.519
>> Online，有几个建议。
&gt;&gt; Online, there's a few suggestions.

104
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.774
个人项目，为开放式源代码提供帮助，以及
Personal projects,
contributing to open source, and

105
00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:42.314
志愿组织了一个非政府组织的编码
volunteering coding for an NGO.

106
00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:45.266
> > 嗯，这些都是实心的。
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are all solid, too.

107
00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:51.204
我唯一的问题是有人说 GitHub 是个开源的
My only issue with people saying yeah,
have a GitHub, contribute to open source,

108
00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:55.970
所有这些都是你要以某种方式利用这个工作的
and all these things, is you have to
leverage that into a job somehow.

109
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.659
否则你就有点工作了
Otherwise you're kind of doing work.

110
00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.831
我建议的最强的一个是联网。
The strongest one I always
recommend is networking.

111
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:02.874
网络，网络，网络。
Network, network, network.

112
00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:06.290
他们不应该在大学教你，他们应该这样做。
It's unpleasant, they don't teach
it to you in college, they should.

113
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.112
但你必须了解认识人的人
But you have to know
people who know people.

114
00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:09.255
交个朋友就好
And just make friends.

115
00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:12.047
它只是向你展示他们想合作的人
It just shows you the type
person they wanna work with.

116
00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:15.315
我在 Netflix 上的工作是在一个开始工作
How I got my job at Netflix was
I was working at a start up and

117
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.649
我申请了一次会议我也参加了
I applied to a conference, and I got in.

118
00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:23.600
然后，我给了一个关于 React的演讲， EX6 ，并不重要。
And then, I gave a talk on React,
EX6, and doesn't really matter.

119
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.694
但事实证明我未来的老板也在场
But it turns out, my future boss
was there at the conference.

120
00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:28.745
我想和这家伙谈谈
Like hey, I wanna talk to this guy.

121
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.488
他好像是个人
He seems like a personable person.

122
00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:35.307
你可以通过我的演讲来告诉我的性格。
You can tell my personality
by how I give talks.

123
00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:39.334
然后，这变成了一种应用，最终变成了一份工作。
And then, that turned into an application,
and that turned into a job eventually.

124
00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:43.009
所以去参加会议，去 meetups ，和人们交谈。
So go to conferences,
go to meetups, talk to people.

125
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.071
网络，网络，网络，网络。
And network, network, network, network.

126
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:50.668
事实上，真实的故事，我有很多真实的故事。
In fact, real story, and
I have plenty of real stories.

127
00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:57.199
这次研讨会的部分准备工作是我在一些地方申请工作。
Part of the preparation for this workshop
is I applied for jobs at places.

128
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.682
我没从招聘者中找到
I didn't get reached out from recruiters.

129
00:05:58.682 --> 00:06:02.216
我尝试过我的简历和我所做的事我的演讲
I just tried to, with my resume and
the things I've done, and my talks and

130
00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:04.384
这些都是我申请的工作
workshops and all that,
I applied for jobs.

131
00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.444
你知道有多少人对我有反应吗
Do you know how many
people responded to me?

132
00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:09.923
零没有人
Zero, nobody.

133
00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:12.947
我申请了亚马逊的一份工作
I applied for a job at Amazon.

134
00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:14.601
他们从来没有回来过我
They never got back to me.

135
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.682
我不是说我是世界上最伟大的工程师
And I'm not saying I'm
the world's greatest engineer.

136
00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:20.350
可能连世界第二大工程师都没说
Probably not even saying the world's
second greatest engineer.

137
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.499
第三次
Third?

138
00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:23.233
也许吧不
Maybe, no.

139
00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:26.615
事实上，他们有成千上万的人。
The fact is they get thousands and
thousands of people.

140
00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.269
如果你不符合他们的算法和准则
And if you don't match whatever
their algorithm or criteria is,

141
00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:31.699
你可能就该过去了
you're probably just
gonna get passed over.

142
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.040
所以真正的方法是交朋友
So the real way to do it
is to make friends or

143
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.000
就跟在亚马逊在推特上工作的人一样
just follow someone who
works at Amazon on Twitter.

144
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.970
然后你就有了互动
And then eventually you
have a interaction.

145
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.180
我不是说这只是操控性的
And I don't mean this to be manipulative,
but

146
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.456
与人们建立真正的互动。
establish a genuine
interaction with people.

147
00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:48.939
然后说嘿你给我开了规矩我在找
And then, say hey,
you got me open rules, I'm looking?

148
00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.175
几乎所有人都会帮你
And almost everybody will help you out.

149
00:06:51.175 --> 00:06:53.538
有人要求把它交给 Netflix
Anybody that's ever asked for
a referral to Netflix,

150
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.985
我从来没帮过他们
I've never not helped them out.

151
00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:57.786
这并不是真正能帮你的工作
It's not really gonna help you
[LAUGH] that's not the way we work.

152
00:06:57.786 --> 00:07:00.350
但我会一直帮你的
But I will always help you out.

153
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.680
我想大多数人会在社区里
I think most people will in the community.

154
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.959
我们都是好人
We're all generally good people.

155
00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:05.430
我们理解想要找到新工作的感觉。
We understand what it's like
to try to find a new job.

156
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.250
我再说一次
So I'll say that again.

157
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.206
网络，网络，会面和会谈。
Network, network, meet-ups, and talks.

158
00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:13.617
是的如果你没有经验你就该这么做
Yes, that's what you should
do if you have no experience.

159
00:07:13.617 --> 00:07:15.449
还有一个网页。
And also have a web page.

160
00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.939
我要知道你能做什么
I need to know what you can do.

161
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:25.860
最后的建议对我来说有点不满，卡兹我不是一个粉丝。
And this last piece of advice is a bit
distasteful for me, cuz I'm not a fan.

162
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.410
但我和很多招聘经理谈过
But I talk to a lot of hiring managers,
and

163
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.060
他们说你需要一个 LinkedIn 档案
they said you need to
have a LinkedIn profile.

164
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.740
它应该列出你的工作地点，以及你的技能。
And it should list where you've worked and
what are your skills.

165
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.319
你必须得 这是他们找到的主要方法之一
You have to.
That's one of the primary ways they find

166
00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.019
人们是 LinkedIn。
people is LinkedIn.

167
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:39.980
这是我个人的意见，我不是太狂野，
This is my personal opinion,
I'm not too wild about it,

168
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.949
界面有点笨重的
the interface is kind of clunky.

169
00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:44.079
但这些都是我们作为专业人士所须做的事情。
But these are things we have
to do as professionals.

170
00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:46.846
因此，具有 LinkedIn 概要文件，具有 Web 页面和网络。
So have a LinkedIn profile,
have a webpage, and network.

171
00:07:46.846 --> 00:07:47.925
怎么了
Yes?

172
00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:52.685
> > 也许吧，我想这是个问题
&gt;&gt; So maybe, I guess it's
a question what do you do with

173
00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:57.240
你的经验不是与 CS 相关的吗
experience that you have
that's not CS related?

174
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.569
是否有一种方法可以应用于您的应用程序?
Is there a way to work it
into your application?

175
00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:05.903
> > 是，那是- >> 还是完全忽略它 ?
&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's-
&gt;&gt; Or do you just ignore it completely?

176
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:08.110
> > 不，那是个大问题。
&gt;&gt; No, no, that's a great question.

177
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.139
我放的，你还能看到我的简历，我有很多经验
What I put, and you can see it even on
my resume, is I have a lot of experience

178
00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.819
在我之前的生活中做过软件工程师
from my previous life before
being a software engineer.

179
00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:18.860
因此，我列举了我的专业经验。
So I list my professional
experience there.

180
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.889
所以这意味着它不是完全包含我所做的一切。
So that means it's not it's not entirely
encompassing of everything I've ever done.

181
00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:25.918
但当你和某人坐下来说嘿
But when you sit down with someone and
you say hey,

182
00:08:25.918 --> 00:08:28.930
你有管理人员的经验你就像我一样
do you have experience managing people,
you're like yes, I did.

183
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.889
我在一个主题公园里管理了几年的人。
I managed people at a theme park
through college for a couple of years.

184
00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:34.076
所以在那里工作
So work it in there.

185
00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:38.681
但在你的 LinkedIn 上，除非你把我的经验
But on your LinkedIn, probably leave out
the less relevant experience unless you

186
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:40.360
真的觉得很关键
really feel it's critical.

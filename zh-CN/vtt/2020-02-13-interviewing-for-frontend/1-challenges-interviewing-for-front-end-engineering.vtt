00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.669
那么，为什么要采访前端特别如此困难?
So why is interviewing for
front end specifically so difficult?

2
00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:07.929
这个问题有很多答案，但给我一些答案。
There are many answers to this,
but give me some.

3
00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.439
把你最好的给我
Give me your best.

4
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.522
> > 科技发展很快。
&gt;&gt; The tech changes quite fast.

5
00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.218
>> [LAUGH] 。
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does.

6
00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:16.146
如果你想打中你的头就会陷入昏迷
If you were to hit your head
go into a coma wake up,

7
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.640
你根本不知道前头到底发生了什么
you would have no idea what's
going on in front end anymore.

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.730
浏览器的工作完全不同，技术完全不同。
Browsers work completely differently,
technology's completely different.

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.359
你说什么角
You're like, what's an angular?

10
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.019
有什么意见
What's a view?

11
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.059
那是 MVC的一部分吗
Is that like part of MVC?

12
00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.111
他们就像是 [ LAUGH] MVC?
They're like, [LAUGH] MVC?

13
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.240
这个人多大了
How old is this person?

14
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.810
还有别的吗
What else?

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.909
为什么采访前线如此困难?
Why is interviewing for
Frontend so difficult?

16
00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.320
我有几个
I've got a few.

17
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.219
一，前端是什么 ?
One, what is the Frontend?

18
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.279
可能有那么多东西
It could be so many things.

19
00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.494
如果你要编程，我不知道，特斯拉，不是前端，
If you're programming for, I don't know,
a Tesla, is that not a front-end,

20
00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:48.966
和你互动的东西吗
something you interact with?

21
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.755
你在编程，我不知道，冰箱，平板
You're programming, I don't know,
a refrigerator, a tablet for

22
00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:56.090
你的冰箱就在前面
your refrigerator, that's the frontend.

23
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.700
浏览器，台式机，移动设备。
Browsers, desktops, mobile devices.

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.840
Fronsay 是如此广泛的范畴，很难说
Frontend is such a broad category
that it's really hard to say

25
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.400
这是前线的一件事只有这件事
this is one thing for
frontend and it's only this.

26
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.299
不不这事太多了
No, no, it's so many broad things.

27
00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.560
在所有工程中， UI 可能是最新的。
And of all the parts of engineering,
UI is probably one of the newest.

28
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.609
对， 20， 30 岁，在那里，可能有点大。
Yeah, it's 20, 30 years old,
around there, maybe a little bit older.

29
00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.859
但在计算机科学的其他方面
But in terms of other
parts of computer science,

30
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.840
前面的情况还是很新的，而且在迅速发展。
the frontend is still very new and
it's evolving quickly.

31
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.900
还有什么是前端面试，那是疯狂的大。
Also what makes front end interviewing,
it's crazy broad.

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.460
太庞大了
It's so huge.

33
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.009
我们可以讨论的话题
The topics we can cover.

34
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.469
如果我说 HTTP 头那是前端
If I said HTTP headers, that's front end.

35
00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.280
这绝对是你要处理的事情
That's definitely something you deal with.

36
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.530
其实任何有 HTTP 的东西都希望你知道
Actually anything with HTTP I would
expect you might have to know as

37
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.539
一个前端工程师，这取决于你的工作。
a front end engineer
depending on your job.

38
00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.200
无障碍，工人，
Accessibility, workers,

39
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.280
任何排序，浏览器兼容性， CSS，我可以
any sort, browser compatibilities,
CSS, I can

40
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.409
继续做你可能要在Fron趋向工程里做的事情
keep going of the things like you might
have to cover in Frontend engineering.

41
00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.680
你可以说，是的，这些是有效的 Fronsend 工程问题。
And you can say, yeah, these are valid
Frontend engineering questions.

42
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.665
嗯。
Yes.

43
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:06.170
>> 网上他们说这是一个不同类型的
&gt;&gt; The online they're saying
that it's a ton of different

44
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.840
作为一个技能集的报价集在一起。
things that are lumped together
as quote unquote one skill set.

45
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.020
>> 是，我们不知道这些是什么，因为我们不理解
&gt;&gt; Yes, and we don't know what those those
are because again, we don't understand

46
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
前面的工程有一半是问题的一半
what frontend engineering is half
the time that's a lot of the problem.

47
00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.170
因此，我们一致认为存在一个问题。
So collectively we agree
there's a problem.

48
00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.639
还有一个问题，我觉得这很滑稽。
And another problem,
I think this is hilarious.

49
00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.909
我没笑我在里面笑
I'm not laughing, I'm laughing inside.

50
00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.240
另一个问题是我们都有不同的想法
Another one problem is we all
have a different idea about

51
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.139
核心概念是什么。
what the core concepts are.

52
00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.490
在 JavaScript I 中作为作用域的基本内容
Something as foundational
as scope in JavaScript I

53
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.920
那天发了个推文，我收到很多人的回应，
tweeted this out the other day,
I got so many responses from people,

54
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.030
比我的狗画更有反应，我对互联网非常失望。
much more response than my dog pictures,
I'm very disappointed with the Internet.

55
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.560
然后我得到工程师的反应
Then I got response from
engineers weighing in, in much,

56
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.199
比我更聪明的工程师
much smarter engineers than me.

57
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.550
他们对什么范围的定义略有不同
And they all had a slightly different
definition about what scope is

58
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.060
在 JavaScript中。
in JavaScript.

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.280
这就是问题的一部分
That's part of the problem is,

60
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.620
我们不分享关于前端工程的集体语言
we don't share this collective language
about what front end engineering is.

61
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.979
Heck，我们甚至不了解 JavaScript 的核心概念
Heck, we don't even understand
the core concepts of JavaScript and

62
00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.400
以万万的方式说
just saying that in a universal way.

63
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.710
这也是一个很大的问题。
And that's a lot of the problem too.

64
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.430
我怎么建网站的想法可能跟你的想法不同
My idea of how to build a website is
probably different from your idea of how

65
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.449
来建立一个网站
to build a website.

66
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:21.500
那么我们如何过去呢 ?
So how do we get past that?

67
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.889
我们如何建立这种水平的领域
How do we establish this
kind of level field

68
00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.289
我们知道我们在说什么
where we understand what
we're talking about.

69
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.340
我们可以有效地沟通。
We can communicate effectively.

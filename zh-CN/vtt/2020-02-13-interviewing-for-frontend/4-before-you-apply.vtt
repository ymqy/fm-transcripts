也许我想看看他们是否注意到我的申请

me if I put in my application.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.199
我有一些小费
I've got some tips on that.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.199
在你申请之前的第一件事，甚至在考虑申请之前，
The first thing before you even apply,
even before you think about applying,

8
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.899
你觉得你现在的工作怎么样

notoriety as an engineering culture?

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.100
想一想你现在的工作是什么样的 ?

14
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.286
然后想想，我接下来要做什么 ?

这很重要
That's important.

16
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.950
很多时候我们盲目地向公司申请
A lot of times we apply it blindly
to companies just trying to see

17
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.450
我们将在那里降落我们不向它方向
where we'll land and
we don't do it with direction.

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.719
我们不是故意的
We don't do with purpose.

19
00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.539
我们不认为我想做下一份工作但你没得到任何想法
We don't think I wanna be at this next
job, but you didn't get any thoughts.

20
00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.548

You get hired, you work there for
a year and you're like I am unhappy.

21
00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:14.772
然后你再这样做，然后你再做一次，而不是让我们
And then you do that again, and
then you do that again, rather than, let's

22
00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:18.965
找到一个你知道你可以成长的家，你可以建造，你可以学习。
find a home where you know you can grow
and you can build and you could learn.

23
00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:23.489
而随着时间的推移你说我很满意我可以向上移动

我只是有很多工作满足感

26
00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.219
大多数人都不这么做
Most people don't do that.

27
00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.739
因为采访是一种crap枪战。

kind of a crapshoot.

我们只是希望我们能在某个地方找到工作

for job, do it with intentionality,

还有什么公司对工程文化有吸引力 ?

新闻里读到的公司吗

read about in the news?

35
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.870
你觉得有公司不好吗，你觉得有公司好吗 ?
Are there companies you think are bad,
are there companies you think are good?

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.459
仔细想想，因为工程文化真的很重要，
Consider that carefully, because
engineering culture is really important,

37
00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.230
我们从不集中精力
and we never focus on it.

38
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.640
我们关注的是工作，而不是，我是否会为下一份工作感到高兴 ?
We focus on getting the job, rather than,
will I be happy this next job?

39
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.039
文化是和我一起的吗
Does the culture vibe with me?

40
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.156
我可以说，事实上有一些公司是我不喜欢工作的
And I can say for a fact there are
companies that I would not enjoy working

41
00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:18.056
啊，大公司，他们花了我很多钱，但是在那里我不高兴。
at, big companies, they pay me a lot of
money, but I wouldn't be happy there.

42
00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:21.156
如果你不打算做任何事情
And what's the point of doing any
of this if you're not gonna be

43
00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:21.936
很高兴你做了什么
happy doing what you do?

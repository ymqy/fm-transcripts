WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.680
到目前为止，我们构建了一个很好的小节点 JS 应用程序。
So so far, we've built a nice
little Node.JS application.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.269
它是在 Debian 上运行的
It's been running on Debian,
which is a perfectly valid and

3
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:08.630
完美的操作系统
perfectly great operating system.

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.785
有很多理由让你在 Debian里做点什么
There's lots of reasons that you
would run something inside of Debian.

5
00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:16.879
但有一个问题是， Debian 相当大。
But there's an issue with the fact
that Debian is quite large.

6
00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:23.140
这个节点包，我想，它的结尾几乎是一个千兆字节之类的东西。
This Node package, I think, ends up being
almost a gigabyte, something like that.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.338
挺大的吧
It's quite large, right?

8
00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:28.460
基本上，它是一个完整的操作系统，至少是它的文件结构。
It's a whole operating system basically,
at least the file structure for it.

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.379
如果我们能做点小的事情就太好了吧
So it'd be great if we could
make something smaller, right?

10
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:34.929
我想给大家介绍一下叫做 Alpine Linux的东西。
So I wanna introduce you to
something called Alpine Linux.

11
00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.630
我们其实已经不小心使用了
It's something that we've actually kind
of already accidentally been using

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.159
因为很多东西都建在 Alpine 的 Linux 里
because a lot of things
are built in Alpine Linux, but

13
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.909
让我们先谈一下吧
let's go ahead and
just have a little chat about it.

14
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.334
所以 Alpine Linux 是最裸露的骨骼
So Alpine Linux is the most bare bones,

15
00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:48.866
它可能是最小的 Linux 发行版。
smallest distribution of Linux
that it can possibly be.

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:53.289
它只包括它认为你需要运行你的
And it includes just the tools that it
thinks that you're gonna need to run your

17
00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.445
毫无实际意义
application and literally nothing.

18
00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:58.140
其他的都是你自己放的对吧
Everything else you have
to put in yourself, right?

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.463
优点是你从 900 兆字节到 5
The advantage is,
is you go from 900 megabytes to 5, so

20
00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:05.319
阿尔卑斯的基本层为 5 兆字节。
Alpine's base layer is 5 megabytes.

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.599
其实你也知道
And actually just so you know,

22
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:11.760
Alpine 实际上是基于另一个叫做 BusyBox的 Linux 发行。
Alpine is actually based on another
distribution of Linux called BusyBox.

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.307
而我相信来自三星的 BusyBox 也许想让我看看这个
And BusyBox I believe came out of Samsung,
may want to look me up on that one.

24
00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:20.109
但 BusyBox 有两兆字节甚至更多的尸骨
But BusyBox is two megabytes,
and it's even more bare bones,

25
00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.829
我建议和 Alpine一起去
I would suggest just going with Alpine.

26
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.460
这些额外的 3 兆字节几乎都是你需要的东西。
Those extra three megabytes are almost
all things that you would need anyway.

27
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.260
所以你还是会重新安装这些东西的
So you would end up
reinstalling that stuff anyway.

28
00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:31.849
在这里与 Alpine Linux 的交易是
The tradeoff here with
Alpine Linux is that

29
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.280
需要更多的工作才能弄点东西对吧
it just requires a lot more work
to get stuff working, right?

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.909
它甚至不包括认证中心。
It doesn't even include
certificate authorities.

31
00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.549
不包括一堆你可能需要的东西
It doesn't include a bunch of stuff
that you would likely need, but

32
00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.439
好消息是它没有你不需要的东西
the good news is,
it includes nothing that you don't need.

33
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.450
一个伟大的例子就是如果你包括德比
A great example of this is
like if you include Debian,

34
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.105
缺省情况下， Debian 为 Python。
on Debian by default is Python.

35
00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:51.150
这是一种伟大的语言。
It's a great language.

36
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.700
我们在应用程序中完全没有使用 Python 。
We did not use Python at
all in our application.

37
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.090
所以这实际上是一个安全漏洞。
So it's actually a security vulnerability.

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.819
因此，如果某人可以进入我们的服务器并下载 Python 文件，那么他们可以
So if someone can get onto our server and
download a Python file, they can

39
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.030
和服务器上的 Python 解释器一起执行，对吧 ?
execute it right away with the Python
interpreter that's on the server, right?

40
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.250
但如果没有 Python 翻译，他们就得找到办法安装它，
But if there's no Python interpreter,
they'd have to find a way to install it,

41
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.580
这比连接到服务器要困难得多
and that's a lot more difficult
than just connecting to a server.

42
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.409
这就是 Alpine Linux 安全的原因
So that's why Alpine Linux is secure,

43
00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.900
只要少些东西就安全了对吧
it's secure by just having
less stuff on it, right?

44
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.210
您只需要消除一系列的安全漏洞。
You just eliminate a whole class of
security vulnerabilities that you'll have.

45
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.680
另一种是，下载速度更快，存储成本更低，
The other thing is, things that download
a lot quicker, they're cheaper to store,

46
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.039
他们跑得更便宜
they're cheaper to run.

47
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.469
我不认为这是其中最大的部分
I don't necessarily think that's
the biggest part of this,

48
00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.750
也许定价权，因为我知道 Azure 容器注册表，
maybe the pricing rights, because I know
things like Azure Container Registry,

49
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.139
它是容器的专用注册表，按大小进行收费。
which is a private registry for
containers, does charge by size.

50
00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.349
所以你会在这方面节省一点钱
So you'll save yourself a little
bit of money in that respect,

51
00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.710
但这不多对吧
but it's not much, right?

52
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.896
所以那是一个好的副作用，安全的部分其实是我认为的
So that's a nice side effect, the security
part is actually what I think is

53
00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:49.097
使用较小版本的 Linux 的令人信服的原因。
the compelling reason to use
a smaller version of Linux.

54
00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:58.129
那么，将你的项目从 Stretch 转至 Alpine 是多么困难 ?
So how hard is it to switch your
project from Stretch to Alpine?

55
00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.115
好吧我们先打个球吧
Well, let's go give it a shot.

56
00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.444
所以我要做的因为我很懒我不想重启
So what I'm gonna do, because I'm lazy and
I don't wanna restart

57
00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:12.228
我的整个计划就是把所有东西都给我
my entire project,
is I'm gonna say cp- r everything in.

58
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:17.318
其实我要用 cd 的方法去把它说出来
Actually I'm gonna cd out of this and I'm
gonna say cp- r, more-complicated that,

59
00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:21.247
我要把它放到一个叫阿尔卑斯 - linux的目录里
and I'm going to put that into
a directory called alpine-linux.

60
00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:23.993
现在我有另一个叫 alpine-linux 的目录
So now I have another directory
called alpine-linux and

61
00:03:23.993 --> 00:03:25.834
我把所有东西都抄过去了
I just copied everything over there.

62
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:32.478
我这样做，希望你可以回去参考你后来建的东西。
I'm doing this so hopefully you can go
back and reference what you built later.

63
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.719
就像你想象的一样，这里的一切都是一样的
So inside of here, as you may imagine,
everything's literally the same,

64
00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.625
但我想把这个项目从 Debian 项目改为 Alpine 项目
but I wanna change this from Debian
project to a Alpine project.

65
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.531
还有一点你要做的巫术
And there's a bit of witchcraft
that you have to do,

66
00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:51.689
你得把这个词改为高山
you have to change the word
stretch to alpine.

67
00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.020
这就是你要做的一切
That's it, that's all you have to do.

68
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.960
那么现在如果我们回到这里说，我是在正确的目录里吗 ?
So now if we go back in here and
say, am I in the right directory?

69
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.549
我不是我要去高山 - linux
I'm not, I have to go into alpine-linux.

70
00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.552
我们要重新开始工作
We're going to run build again, and again,

71
00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:14.634
如果你想的话你可以给所有这些都有不同的标签
you could put different tags
on all these if you wanted to.

72
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:21.523
我不会去的
I'm not going to.

73
00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:23.529
你可以看到有更多的层。
So you can see there's
a couple more layers.

74
00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.271
我觉得节点一加节点到它大概是二十兆字节左右，
I think the Node one, once you add Node
into it, ends up being about 20 megabytes,

75
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.329
对， cuz 有一些工具可以和节点和 NPM 一起使用
right, cuz there's some tools that
come around with Node and NPM and

76
00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:31.399
都是那种东西
all that kind of stuff.

77
00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.862
再加上一堆节点模块，它们也会占用空间。
Plus you're gonna include a bunch of Node
modules, they'll take up space as well.

78
00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:40.750
我想都是这么说的，我之前测量过这个，
I think all said and done,
I measured this earlier, and

79
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.797
我相信我们刚刚建造的这个集装箱是 80 兆字节，
I believe this container that we just
built I believe is 80 megabytes,

80
00:04:45.797 --> 00:04:50.209
而不是 913 ，我觉得是我测量的另一个。
as opposed to 913,
I think is what I measured the other one.

81
00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.473
所以是 913 到 86
So yeah, 913 to 86.

82
00:04:53.473 --> 00:05:01.860
如果我们去码头检查我的程序
And if we just go to
docker inspect my-app.

83
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.209
在这里它会告诉你它有多大，大小，就在那里。
Somewhere in here it will tell you
how big it is, size, right there.

84
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:13.620
所以你得去计算出多少字节。
So you'd have to go and calculate
how many bytes that translates into.

85
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.095
根据我的资料，那是 86 兆字节。
According to my documentation here,
that's 86 megabytes.

86
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.836
好了，现在，如果我们继续，再试一次。
All right, so now if we go ahead and
try and run this again.

87
00:05:27.047 --> 00:05:28.660
就在那儿就在那儿
Right there, right there, right there.

88
00:05:31.576 --> 00:05:32.490
没问题的
Works just fine.

89
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.129
但我们现在要去阿尔卑斯而不是 Debian
But instead of using Debian,
we're now on to Alpine, but

90
00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.149
我们只是用更少的方法挽救了整个一类的虫子
we just saved ourself an entire class
of bugs by including much less.

91
00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.058
现在有一个 Debian 的分发
Now, there is a Debian distribution called

92
00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:50.949
Debian SliM 如果我去了 12 人
Debian SLiM, so if I went 12-stretch-slim,

93
00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.300
我认为你会下降到大约 150 兆字节，但是你仍然会得到完全的 Debian。
I think you go down to about 150
megabytes, but you still get full Debian.

94
00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.470
这也是一种可能性。
So that's a possibility as well.

95
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.230
我知道很多人都这么做 Ubuntu 也这么做
I know lots of people do that,
Ubuntu used to do that as well,

96
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.589
有 Ubuntu 苗条，现在还没有完全 Ubuntu。
that there was Ubuntu slim and
now actually there is no full Ubuntu.

97
00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:08.040
只是 Ubuntu 瘦了还有其他的要做的
It's just Ubuntu slim and everything
else you have to build yourself.

98
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.548
可能有一个完整的地方但我不知道怎么弄
There might be a full one somewhere,
but I don't know how to get it,

99
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:11.475
但这不重要
cuz it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:19.790
太好了
So, pretty good.

101
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.615
嗯，节点最新，上次我看的是 908 兆字节。
Yeah, node latest,
last time I checked was 908 megabytes.

102
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.781
而节点:12-alpine 大约为 80。
Whereas node:12-alpine is about 80.

103
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.860
很明显的区别
Pretty stark difference.

104
00:06:34.634 --> 00:06:38.959
这就是我想谈谈 Linux 发行版的地方。
So this is kind of where I wanted to talk
a little bit about distributions of Linux.

105
00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:42.990
第一，我不是 Linux 大师，任何想象力都是一样的。
One, I'm not a Linux master by
any stretch of the imagination.

106
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.209
当我使用 Linux 时，我就会使用 Ubuntu ，因为这就是我所了解的。
When I use Linux, I use Ubuntu just
because that's the one I know.

107
00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:47.459
这是我一直用的
That's the one I've always used.

108
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.689
有些代理，我知道 Debian ，因为 Ubuntu 是基于 Debian的，对吧 ?
By some proxy, I know a bit about Debian
because Ubuntu is based on Debian, right?

109
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.910
所以我的默认是我用 Ubuntu 或 Debian 来做任何我在本地做的事情。
So my default is I use Ubuntu or Debian
for anything that I'm doing locally.

110
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.139
它有我知道如何使用的所有工具。
It has all the tools I know how to use.

111
00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.480
当我把东西送到生产的时候
And then any time that I'm sending
stuff out to production, I try and

112
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.360
把它弄上阿尔派恩
get it on Alpine.

113
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.870
因为那是更小的，对的，更安全。
Because then it's smaller,
right, and more secure.

114
00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.598
但是您完全可以使用 RHEL， Red Hat Enterprise Linux，
But you can totally do things with RHEL,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

115
00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:17.420
这是另一个伟大的 Linux 发行版
that's another great
distribution of Linux Mint.

116
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:23.158
SUSE， Kali，它们都是 Linux的好分布。
SUSE, Kali,
they're all good distributions of Linux.

117
00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:26.310
我最后想提的关于阿尔派恩的事
The last thing I wanted
to mention about Alpine.

118
00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.399
所以它甚至不包括巴什。
So it doesn't even include bash.

119
00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:38.689
这可能是我最难做的事，因为我必须这样做。
That's probably the hardest part about
this for me is that I have to do -it.

120
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:49.148
有一堆东西在用叫灰的东西
There's a bunch of stuff that,
it's using something called ash,

121
00:07:49.148 --> 00:07:52.552
A-S-H 而不是 bash，它是一个最小的外壳和
A-S-H instead of bash,
which is a minimalistic shell and

122
00:07:52.552 --> 00:07:56.110
不是一个满满的空壳是什么巴什是吧
not a full born-again shell,
which is what bash is, right?

123
00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:00.810
所以是有区别的，我不认识，对吧 ?
So there are differences and
I don't know them, right?

124
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.870
所以，对于我来说，我并不是一直使用 Alpine 的原因之一
So that, for me, is one of the reasons
that I don't use Alpine all the time is

125
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.848
因为我不太了解阿什
because I don't know Ash very well.

126
00:08:06.848 --> 00:08:07.970
那是我最后想说的
That was the last thing
I wanted to mention.

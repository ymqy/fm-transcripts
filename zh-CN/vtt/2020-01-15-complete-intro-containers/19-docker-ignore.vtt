00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.750
同样地，在这里，所有这些项目都在这里，
Again, like here in layers, all this
entire projects in here, and there's

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.900
真正能帮助你的事情我们就能快点过去了
something that actually will help you,
let's actually go over that really quick.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.836
因此，存在一个称为 Docker 忽略文件的概念，并且
So, there is a concept of something
called a Docker ignore file, and

4
00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:18.684
Docker 忽略文件很像 gitignore 文件，您说，
a Docker ignore file is much like
a gitignore file, do you say like,

5
00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.960
有一堆我不想让你复出的东西
here's a bunch of stuff that I
don't want you to copy over.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.432
实际上是为了证明我的观点
And actually to prove my point here,

7
00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:32.368
再把我的指挥线拉上来如果我说 Docker
let's pull up my command line here again,
and if I say Docker,

8
00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:37.856
就像我的笔记应用程序一样
let's just do Docker run here,
like this my note app, and

9
00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:44.039
如果我说 Ls- lsha别把那不是我想要的
if I say, Ls- lsha,
don't detach that's not what I wanted.

10
00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.493
没有复制那个，在默认情况下是这样做的，所以
It didn't copy that over,
it used to do that by default, so

11
00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.896
有时它会复制到您的 Git 目录中
sometimes it'll copy for your Git
directory which is not necessarily

12
00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:03.649
你需要的东西这不是 Git 项目
something that you need inside of your,
this isn't a Git project.

13
00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.852
但是如果是再一次的话，项目，对，所以我说其实呢，就这样做，
But if it was again, project, right, so
if I said like, in fact, let's just do it,

14
00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:11.531
获取 IT ，并且
get an IT, And

15
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:16.667
然后我又做了，然后就跑了
then I built it again, and then I ran it

16
00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:22.640
再说，让我们把它带回曝光曝光的那个。
again, Let's get it back to the one
that the expose is on publish.

17
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.195
顺便说一下，我从来没有这样做过，
Just FYI, instead of publish,
I never actually do that,

18
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:32.400
我是 -p ，就是速记，小写 p，对吧 ?
I do -p which is just the shorthand,
lowercase p, right?

19
00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:40.265
好吧那就好了如果我做了
Okay, so that's working,
now if I do ls- lsha,

20
00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:44.591
发现它正在复制到 git 目录
notice that it's copying
over the git directory,

21
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.979
需要在生产服务器中使用吗 ?
do you need that in
your production server?

22
00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.750
否，您是否需要新的生产服务器?
No, do you even want
a new production server?

23
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.009
不，这就像是安全漏洞，对吧 ?
No, it's actually like
a security vulnerability, right?

24
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.331
因为你有你的 git 历史和一堆东西
Because you've your git history and
a bunch of stuff in there, so

25
00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.588
其实应该被认为是敏感的信息。
it's actually should be
considered sensitive information.

26
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.855
这样我们就可以明确地将所有我们想要的文件夹命名为这个
So we could go and explicitly name all the
folders that we wanna white list into this

27
00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:08.126
但我觉得这不是很有用的模式
but I don't think that's a very
useful pattern at all, so

28
00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:12.231
我们要做的就是触摸点 dockerignore
what we're gonna do instead is we're
gonna say touch .dockerignore.

29
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:18.608
如果你写了一个忽略文件的文件，它的格式是一样的，
And if you've ever written a git ignore
file, it's literally the same format,

30
00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:25.069
所以如果我在这里打开它，你可以看到我在这里有一个 dockerignore 文件。
so if I open this here, oops, you can
see I have a dockerignore file here.

31
00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.495
如果我放了它那就是我们要忽略的另一个
And if I just put .git, that's one we
wanna ignore and the other one that we've

32
00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:34.069
谈到忽略是 node_modules，我们从不希望复制节点模块。
talked about ignoring is node_modules,
we never wanna copy over node modules.

33
00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.162
如果你想把它像个目录但是
And you can put that slash too if you
wanna make it like a directory, but,

34
00:02:37.162 --> 00:02:39.610
它的格式与忽略它的格式相同。
again, it's literally the same
format as a git ignore.

35
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.298
如果它与路径中任何位置的节点模块相匹配，
Just if it matches any node
modules anywhere in the path,

36
00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:44.206
它会说不把它带过来
it'll say nope not bringing that over.

37
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.711
关于医生的问题忽视了吗 ?
Questions about doctor ignore?

38
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:54.158
每个项目至少应该在其 dockerignore 中具有 .git 。
Every project should at least
have .git in its dockerignore.

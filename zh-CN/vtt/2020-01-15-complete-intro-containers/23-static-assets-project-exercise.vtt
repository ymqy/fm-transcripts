1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.488
我刚刚给你展示了如何用 Node.js 做多阶段的建设
So I just showed you how to do
a multistage build with a Node.js

2
00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:05.389
应用程序，对吗 ?
application, right?

3
00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:09.692
我现在要你做的就是我要让你做一个
So what I'm gonna have you do now is I'm
gonna have you do a multistage build with

4
00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:10.992
就像一个静态的网站
like a static website.

5
00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:14.928
这一个叫静态资产项目。
This one down here that's
called Static Assets Project.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.099
这里有所有指示和
So, here's all the instructions and

7
00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.393
如果你在这里滚动看我的答案我就觉得
then if you see right here to scroll
down to see my answer, I just feel like

8
00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.699
如果你在这里滚动就会有很大的空间它会给你展示答案
a big space if you scroll all the way
down here it will show you the answer.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.269
这也是我之前给你看的 GitHub 存储库
It's also in that GitHub repo
that I showed you earlier.

10
00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.000
那么，您有多少人熟悉 Create React App?
So how many of you are familiar
with Create React App?

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.780
想象一下你们中的许多人，对，如果不是在 Fronsend Masters 中有那么大的粗粗
Imagine many of you, right, if not there's
a great coarse in Frontend Masters

12
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.070
这就是第 5 版 React 的完整简介
that's called the complete
intro to React version five.

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.969
好吧，你不必再做任何 " 重做 " 的部分了
All right, you don't have to do
any of the React parts of it.

14
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.222
我们只需要创建 React 应用来为您打掉一个项目。
We are just gonna do Create React App
to scuffle out a project for you.

15
00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.929
所以，我们还是先开始吧。
So, let's actually just go ahead and
get started.

16
00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.637
就像我让你和你的 React 部分一起跑
Like I'll get you up and
running with the React portion of this and

17
00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:02.704
那么我将离开您构建实际 Docker 文件。
then I'll leave you to build
the actual Docker file.

18
00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:07.981
这里的想法是我们要创建一个 " 创建雷act应用" 。
See, the idea here is that we're
gonna create a Create React App.

19
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.587
我们要把它建成一个建筑项目对吧
We're gonna build that into
a built project, right?

20
00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:15.055
然后我们会把所有这些文件复制到一个 Nginx 容器
And then we're gonna copy all those
files into an Nginx container and

21
00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:21.299
Nginx 容器会为我们提供所有静态资产好吗
the Nginx container is gonna serve all
of our static assets for us, Okay?

22
00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.219
所以让我们继续吧我要复制这个可爱的小熊
So let's go ahead, I'm gonna just
copy this cuz it's really long.

23
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.450
Npx ，这将运行 " 创建 - 响应"应用程序。
Npx, this is gonna run create-react-app.

24
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.210
最近他们就像上周一样改变了创造反应应用的方式
They recently like probably last week,
changed how create-react-app works so

25
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.640
我必须彻底改变这个
I had to totally change this.

26
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.395
昨晚我做了一件好事
It's a good thing I tried this last night.

27
00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:40.189
很尴尬的可爱的
[LAUGH] Cuz that would have
been real embarrassing,

28
00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.539
React 老师对 React不了解
the React teacher doesn't
know shit about React.

29
00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.912
我是说也许是真的谁知道呢
I mean, might be true, who knows.

30
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.780
好了我们要回去了你要干什么
All right, so we're gonna go back in,
what are you doing?

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.280
别这样
Stop that.

32
00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:55.778
好吧那我就在我的 " 去集装箱 " 项目里了对吧
All right, so I'm here in my
intro-to-containers project, right?

33
00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120
我会指挥我在那里说的
I'm gonna run that command
that I said in there,

34
00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.769
直接从晚上开始就可以了
which is gonna run it off of npm directly.

35
00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:05.069
它会运行 " 创建 - 反应-应用" 。
It's gonna run create-react-app.

36
00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.513
它将创建一个称为静态资产项目的项目。
It's gonna create a project
called static-assets-project.

37
00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:11.199
这将是典型的版本，而我们并不是混淆不清的纱线。
And it's gonna be the typescript
version and we're not confused yarn.

38
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.430
为什么要使用 TypeScript?
Why are we gonna use TypeScript?

39
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.043
这是我让你使用更多微软产品的另一个伎俩。
It's another ploy for me to get you
to use more Microsoft products.

40
00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.853
其实我只是想让你像个建筑过程一样
Actually, I just wanna show you like
as involved as a build process as

41
00:02:19.853 --> 00:02:21.219
有可能，对吧 ?
possible, right?

42
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.550
这其实并不重要。
And that doesn't actually really matter.

43
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.939
因此，这需要几分钟时间来完成所有设置。
So this will take a couple
minutes to get everything set up.

44
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.750
如果您收到一条说明，说明您没有关联的模板
If you get a note that says, you don't
have a template associated with your

45
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.469
这就是我在做这件事时所看到的
project or something like that, which is
what I was seeing when I was doing this

46
00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:42.030
昨天晚上，卸载您的全局安装 " 创建 - 响应"应用程序。
last night, uninstall your global
installation of create-react-app.

47
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.401
这就是我最终解决的问题。
That's what eventually solved it for me.

48
00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:48.941
此忽略现有，希望该忽略
This ignore existing,
hopefully should sidestep that for

49
00:02:48.941 --> 00:02:54.432
你，但是如果没有，这就是我最终解决问题的方式。
you, But if it doesn't, that's how
I was eventually solved problem.

50
00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:01.129
好吧这可能需要花 30 秒的时间
Okay, this will take maybe, I'm gonna
guess like 30 more seconds to get through.

51
00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.199
因此，这将安装使用 TypeScript的 React 项目。
So, this is gonna go install a React
project that uses TypeScript.

52
00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.810
然后就为了好玩你和
And then just for fun, you and

53
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.050
我要把 SAS 放到 SAS 里，就像一堆依赖性。
I are gonna go put in SAS as well just
to have like a bunch of dependencies.

54
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.030
你会在这里看到我的笔记，我把它写在上面，它是可有可无的。
So you'll see here my notes,
I have this where it says optional.

55
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.550
我要这样做但如果你不觉得有什么感觉
I'm gonna do this but you could totally
skip this if you're not feeling it or

56
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.818
给你点东西
something breaks for you.

57
00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:28.850
但我把它放进去的原因是如果你运行节点模块
But the reason why I'm putting this in
there is if you run the node modules and

58
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.042
npm 安装在本地，这将在您将其复制到容器中时中断。
the npm install locally, this will break
when you copy it in the container.

59
00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:37.478
它将为 Mac 或 Windows 构建它，并且不会为 Linux 构建它，
Cuz it'll build it for Mac or for
Windows and it won't build it for Linux,

60
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:40.591
除非你在 Linux 上我不知道怎么打破电脑
unless you're on Linux then I don't
know how to break a computer.

61
00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:42.959
我可以试试
I could try.

62
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.699
发生什么事了
What is going on here?

63
00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:50.861
你真是太好了
Well, that's nice of you.

64
00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:56.632
好了好了好了好了
All right, there we go, happy hacking.

65
00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:04.455
所以现在如果我们进入静态资产项目
So now if we go into
the static-assets-project, You'll

66
00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:08.687
这里有个比较完整的项目
see here you have a relatively
full project here.

67
00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:13.259
我想让你做的第一件事就是让你创建一个 dockerignore。
The first thing I want you to do is
I want you to create a dockerignore.

68
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:22.502
让我们打开并编辑该文档库忽略缺省情况下不会出现的文件库。
And let's open and edit that dockerignore
file cuz that won't come by default.

69
00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:29.937
就在这里
Inside of here, So

70
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.572
你也可以进来说新文件， dockerignore，对吗 ?
you can also just come in here and
say New File, dockerignore, right?

71
00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:36.505
我们将忽略 .git 目录
We're gonna ignore .git directories and

72
00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:41.485
我们会忽略 node_module 目录我们也会忽略
we're gonna ignore node_module
directories and we'll also ignore,

73
00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.252
好吧那就好
Yeah, anyway, that's fine.

74
00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.516
这里也可能有个缓存
There might be a cache in here as well.

75
00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:53.702
不我不觉得有
No, I don't think there is.

76
00:04:53.702 --> 00:04:57.281
总之我们会先做的好吗
Anyway, So we'll do that first, okay?

77
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:02.199
我想让你到这里来的另一件事是我想让你说 npm 的安装。
The next thing I want you to go in
here is I want you to say npm install.

78
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.091
这是可选部件，节点 - sass。
This is the optional part, node-sass.

79
00:05:09.327 --> 00:05:13.161
然后我们就会到这里来
And then while that's doing that,
we're gonna come in here and

80
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:15.579
我们要重命名源文件
we're going to rename our source file.

81
00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.975
这是 App.css，只需右键单击该名称并进行命名。
So there's App.css,
just right click on that and say rename.

82
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.942
把一个人放在 css 前面
And just put an s in front of the css.

83
00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:30.589
这不是一个 SASS 课程，我不教你任何 SASS。
So this is not a SASS class,
I'm not teaching you any SASS.

84
00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.170
我都不赞成使用 SASS，对吧 ?
I'm not even necessarily
endorsing the use of SASS, right?

85
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.290
我再也不用自己了
I don't use it myself anymore.

86
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.579
但是，所有 css 都是有效的 SASS 或有效的 scss，对，所以
But, all css is valid SASS or
valid scss, right, so

87
00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:42.959
这就是为什么你能改变它而不改变里面的任何东西
that's why you're able to just change it
without changing anything inside of it.

88
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:47.100
所以我们把它们都命名为 css。
So we name both of these to be s.css.

89
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.279
然后在两个地方你得换个地方
And then in two places
you need to go change.

90
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:54.350
那么， App.tsx，仅将其更改为 scss。
So, App.tsx, just change that to scss.

91
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.500
他们在 3 号线上然后在 index.tsx上
They're on line 3, and then on index.tsx,

92
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.810
和小童子军一样好吗
same thing here scss, okay?

93
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.615
所以现在我们也有一个 SASSified project ，所以是 TypeScript ，是 SASS
So now we have a SASSified project as
well, so it's TypeScript, it's SASS so

94
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:10.569
这里有很多依赖关系的人对吧
there's a lot of dependencies
flying around here, right?

95
00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:16.519
所以要确保一切顺利
So just to make sure
that everything works,

96
00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:21.606
我们会说晚上的事开始了我想那是什么
we're gonna say npm run start,
I think is what it is.

97
00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.963
我们的计划应以发展模式在本港展开。
And our project should start
locally in the development mode.

98
00:06:31.552 --> 00:06:36.755
我可能还有点东西要从 3000 口开始
I might still have something
running on port 3,000, To start.

99
00:06:42.874 --> 00:06:44.345
好了好了好了
There we go, there you go.

100
00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:50.911
所以，美丽的香草节点项目在这里，对，不是节点，而是 " 雷法" 。
So, pretty vanilla node project here,
right, or not node, but React.

101
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:54.750
你知道这其实是 React v6 的完整简介
Little did you know this is actually
the complete intro to React v6 and

102
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.848
我们现在就开始了开个玩笑
we're starting now, just kidding.

103
00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:58.307
那将是一个激烈的过程
That would be an intense course,

104
00:06:58.307 --> 00:07:01.310
所有容器都将重新回到容器中。
containers all the way to
React back to containers.

105
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.589
接受挑战
Challenge accepted.

106
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:07.560
这就是你需要知道的关于这件事的反应。
That's all you need to know about React
for this particular piece of the course.

107
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.569
因此，请继续并停止该服务器。
So go ahead and stop that server.

108
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.019
所以你建造这个项目的方式是你会说 npm 的运行，对吧 ?
So the way that you build this project is
you're gonna say npm run build, right?

109
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.167
这是一个提示它可能要进入你的 Dockerfile，对吧 ?
This is a note to take cuz it's probably
gonna go into your Dockerfile, right?

110
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:23.694
这会让我们把所有东西都建在
And this'll go through and
this'll actually build everything out into

111
00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:28.307
一个目录，它创造了一个优化的生产结构，对吧 ?
a directory, so it's creating
an optimized production build, right?

112
00:07:30.175 --> 00:07:34.728
因此，这将生成您的所有 index.html，您的 CSS和您的 JavaScript。
So this is gonna generate all of your
index.html, your CSS's, your JavaScripts.

113
00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:41.108
现在，我们有了这个构建目录。
And so now we have this build directory.

114
00:07:41.108 --> 00:07:44.968
所以如果你看看你的建筑目录，你可以看到这里，
So if you look inside of your
build directory, you can see here,

115
00:07:44.968 --> 00:07:50.230
它有一个收藏的，有一个清单，这里有一堆东西，对吧 ?
it's got a favicon, it's got a manifest,
it's got a bunch of stuff in here, right?

116
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.481
那关键是你有一个静态的目录
Then the key here being that
you have a static directory

117
00:07:55.481 --> 00:08:01.288
build/， Static.
build/, Static.

118
00:08:01.288 --> 00:08:05.240
你可以看到有 CSS，有 JS，有媒体，对吧 ?
You can see there's the CSS,
there's JS, there's media, right?

119
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.220
我只想说如果你把整个建筑目录复制
Suffice to say, if you copy
the entire build directory across,

120
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.199
那就是你最后的计划了
that's gonna be your
finally built project.

121
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.992
所以我要你去你的码头
So as such,
I want you to go into your dockerignore,

122
00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:20.682
在你的随机项目中
Inside of your stochastics project.

123
00:08:20.682 --> 00:08:23.504
我们要在这里再加上一条线
And we're gonna add one more line
here to our dockerignore and

124
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:28.764
就像这样建造的那样
that is going to be, Built, like that.

125
00:08:31.324 --> 00:08:34.133
这样我们就不会像一个预先构建的项目那样意外地复制。
So that we won't accidentally
copy like a pre-built project.

126
00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:43.360
好了这就是我要让你去做这个项目的地方
Okay, so at this point, this is where
I'm gonna leave you to do the project.

127
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.710
你要做的就是多做个多阶段的建筑对吧
So what you're gonna need to do is you're
gonna have a multi-stage build, right?

128
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.860
然后你就会去你的项目
And you're gonna go and
you're going to copy in the project,

129
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.049
你要建这个项目对吧
you're gonna build the project, right?

130
00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:53.629
然后你会把那个输出和
And then,
you're gonna take that output and

131
00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:57.669
你会把它复制到 Nginx 的容器里吧
you're gonna copy it into
a Nginx container, right?

132
00:08:57.669 --> 00:08:59.961
所以我想让你使用的容器
So the container that I want you to use,

133
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:07.081
如果我们回到这里我的意思是这里有任何东西
if we come back here,
I mean it's anything in here.

134
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.332
你可以做最新的，你可以做高山。
You can do Nginx latest,
you can do alpine.

135
00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:14.769
我想我可以使用 Nginx 117，我认为这是最新的。
I think I have it so you can use Nginx
117, which I believe is the latest.

136
00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:17.838
所以如果你想把它绑在合适的版本上像我说的那样
So if you wanna tie it to a proper version
like I've been telling to do I think

137
00:09:17.838 --> 00:09:18.975
117 是正确的。
117 is the correct one.

138
00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:26.480
让我看看这是否是正确的，我在这里写的。
Let me just triple check that that's the
correct, cuz I have it written out here.

139
00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.494
正确版本为 NGINX 1.17。
The correct version is NGINX 1.17.

140
00:09:31.494 --> 00:09:33.534
这就是我想让你在那里使用的
So this is the one that I
want you to use right there.

141
00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:41.341
好吧那就有一个很特别的地方
Okay, and then, so
there's a very specific place that you

142
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:45.840
要复制它就在这里
have to copy it, Which is here.

143
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.320
因此，将构建文件复制到用户/share/nginx/html，
So copy the build files
to user/share/nginx/html,

144
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.629
所有东西都进了那个目录对吧
everything goes into that directory,
right?

145
00:09:51.629 --> 00:09:55.311
然后不要修改 CMD ，因为 Nginx 知道如何启动它自己。
And then don't modify the CMD, because
Nginx knows how to start itself and so

146
00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:56.962
你不会想改写的
you don't wanna overwrite that.

147
00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:02.562
所以如果你把一切都复制到 Nginx 的正确目录
So if you just copy everything into this
correct directory Nginx will take care of

148
00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:03.287
其余的给你
the rest for you.

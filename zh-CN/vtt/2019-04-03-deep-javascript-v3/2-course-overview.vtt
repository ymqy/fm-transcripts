00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.750
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：我认为JavaScript可以分为三个核心，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I believe JavaScript can be divided into three cores,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.919
如果你愿意的话，有三根柱子。
three pillars if you will.

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.730
这三个支柱绝对是至关重要的
And those three pillars are absolutely critical for

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.990
你将要做的所有JavaScript编码，
all of the JavaScript coding that you will ever do,

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.899
即使它有品牌名称react或品牌名称Vue.js或品牌棱角。
even if it has the brand name React or the brand name Vue.js or the brand Angular.

6
00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:19.910
你猜怎么着？
Guess what?

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.179
甚至对像我这样的老校友来说，
Or even for the old school folks like me,

8
00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.019
即使它是jQuery，它仍然是JavaScript，好吗？
even if it's jQuery it's still JavaScript, okay?

9
00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.629
而这些东西仍然是基于相同的基本支柱。
And those things are still based upon the same fundamental pillars.

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.807
我看到开发人员总是缠绕着自己，扭曲着自己
And I see developers all the time, winding themselves and contorting themselves

11
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:39.573
围绕着他们特定框架内的所有类型的怪异或
around all kinds of certain weirdness within their particular framework or

12
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.838
不管他们在做什么。
utility whatever it is they're working on.

13
00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:46.142
结果是他们不理解其中一根柱子，或者
And it turns out it's they don't understand one of the pillars, or

14
00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:48.340
其中一根柱子的一部分。
some part of one of these pillars.

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.307
本课程旨在解决这个问题。
And this course aims to fix that.

16
00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:55.216
我有一个疯狂的想法，如果你出于什么原因选择了你
I have this crazy notion that if for whatever reason you've chosen you

17
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:59.957
要让您的职业成为一名JavaScript开发人员，如果您选择了
to make your career be a JavaScript developer, if you've chosen to

18
00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:04.555
为了获得写JavaScript的报酬，你应该理解你的工具。
get paid to write JavaScript, you oughta understand your tool.

19
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:07.016
那么我们要怎么看这三根柱子呢？
So what are we going to look at those three pillar?

20
00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.996
这些柱子中的第一个可能是最不受欢迎的
The first of those pillars may be the least popular of them actually definitely

21
00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:14.192
其中最不受欢迎的，没有人喜欢谈论类型和
the least popular of them, nobody likes to talk about types and

22
00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:17.632
特别是在像JavaScript这样的动态类型语言中，
especially within a dynamically typed language like JavaScript,

23
00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:19.402
这是一个禁忌话题。
this is one of those taboo topics.

24
00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:24.754
如果你跟随道格·克罗克福德，他会告诉你不要使用这些东西
If you follow a Doug Crockford, he tells you don't use any of this stuff don't

25
00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:30.043
当然，想想这些事情中的任何一个，这实际上是不实际的。
think about any of these things of course, that isn’t actually practical.

26
00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:34.270
我们将讨论为什么你应该关心类型。
And we're gonna talk about why you should care about types.

27
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.680
但我还是会在这里说漏嘴的。
But I will just go ahead and spill the beans here.

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.890
这个特别的核心对于这个特别的单位的意义是，
The takeaway from this particular core for this particular unit is,

29
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.870
你写代码是不负责任的
it is irresponsible of you to write code and

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.520
不理解语言的这个关键事实，好吗？
not understand this critical fact of the language, okay?

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.219
说，好吧，有些好的部分告诉我要避免这样做是不负责任的
It is irresponsible to say, well, some good parts told me to just avoid that

32
00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.799
话题，不要学，不用担心。
topic, don't learn it, don't need to worry about it.

33
00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.659
这是人们在代码中产生bug的主要原因之一。
That is one of the big reasons why people produce bugs in their code.

34
00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.530
他们写代码，但他们不理解他们正在写的代码，好吗？
They write code and they don't understand the code that they're writing, okay?

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.389
所以我们将涵盖类型，特别是强制系统。
So we're gonna cover the types and specifically the coercion system.

36
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.639
现在，我要求对此持开放的态度，因为我知道你一直如此
Now, I'm gonna ask to have an open mind on it because I know you have been so

37
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.639
被编程认为我们不需要做这些事情，我们应该只是
programmed to think that we don't need to do these things, we should only just

38
00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.219
使用三等号，如果我们使用三等号，谁还需要关心呢？
use the triple equals, and who needs to care about it if we use the triple equals?

39
00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.569
这不是编写JavaScript的实用方法。
That is just not a practical way of writing JavaScript.

40
00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.340
你一直过得很好，但效果不好。
You've been getting by, and it's not effective.

41
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.729
所以当我告诉你的时候，我会要求你有一个开放的心态，也许更开放一些
So I'm gonna ask you to have an open mind when I tell you, and maybe more so

42
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.599
比以往任何时候，我都会有一个非常强烈的，
than I have ever before, I'm gonna have a very strong,

43
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.069
我要坚定地把我的脚踩在你应该是什么的位置上
I'm gonna firmly plant my foot in a position here about what you should be

44
00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.060
使用强制执行时，您应该使用JavaScript的类型系统进行操作。
doing with coercion, what you should be doing with JavaScript's type system.

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.930
在过去，我有一些观点，就像是好吧，你自己做吧
In the past I've sort of have views that were kind of like well just make your own

46
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.949
一些决定，但我开始相信，我的观点发生了转变
sorts of decisions but I have come to believe, my views have shifted and

47
00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.780
我必须相信有一个正确的方式来思考这个问题
I have to come believe there is a correct way to think about this and

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.930
我们还没到那一步。
we're not getting there yet.

49
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.520
作为一个社区，我们还没有做到这一点。
We're not there yet as a community.

50
00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.039
所以我们在这门课上可以做的最重要的事情之一就是
So maybe one of the most important things we can do in this course is

51
00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.620
告诉你为什么这很重要好吗？
enlighten you to why that's so important okay?

52
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.560
我们将要讨论的第二个核心单元是示波器系统。
The second core unit that we're going to talk about is the scope system.

53
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.129
词汇范围，引导我们讨论闭包和
Lexical scopes which leads us into discussions about closure and

54
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.299
最终是模块化模式。
eventually the modular pattern.

55
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.629
这是语言的重要支柱。
This is a critical pillar of the language.

56
00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.750
几乎所有其他东西都是建立在它之上的。
Almost everything else is built upon it.

57
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.400
第三个支柱是客体系统。
And the third of the pillars is the objects system.

58
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.159
我喜欢把这称为面向对象，有点不同于
I like to refer to this as the objects oriented, a little bit different than

59
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.150
面向对象，实际上是面向类的。
object oriented, which is actually class oriented.

60
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.250
我们需要了解JavaScript的对象系统是如何工作的，
We need to understand how JavaScript's objects system works,

61
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.400
其中包括this关键字，这个完全令人困惑的东西
which includes the this keyword, that completely befuddling thing that's

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.889
实际上，一旦你被教会了它的作用，就会变得非常直截了当。
actually very straightforward once you've been taught what it does.

63
00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.909
一旦你脱离了它在其他语言中的作用
Once you disconnect from what it does in other languages and

64
00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.629
您将了解它在JavaScript中的作用，它非常简单。
you learn what it does in JavaScript, it's very straightforward.

65
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.629
所以对我们来说理解这三个核心是很重要的。
So it's important for us to understand all three of these cores.

66
00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.420
当我们深入研究这个
And when we dig into this and

67
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.840
然后我们深入研究原型，你必须先了解这些东西，然后才能
then we dig into the prototypes, you have to understand that stuff before you can

68
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.280
了解某人在顶部分层的语法糖分，如class关键字。
understand somebody layering on top a syntactic sugar like the class keyword.

69
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.030
我没有在网上隐藏我关于class关键字的想法和选项
I have not hidden my thoughts and options online about the class keyword and

70
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.159
我再告诉你一次，我坚信它不应该在JavaScript中使用。
I will tell you again I firmly believe that it should not be used in JavaScript.

71
00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.110
但我说你不应该用它和
But there is a difference between me saying, you shouldn't use it and

72
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.220
我说你不应该学。
me saying you shouldn't learn it.

73
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.220
你绝对应该学习这个系统。
You absolutely should learn this system.

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.891
你绝对必须学习这个支柱才能理解为什么
You absolutely must learn this pillar to understand why that particular

75
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:29.718
编码风格不适合JavaScript，顺便说一句，要理解，
coding style doesn't fit with JavaScript and to understand, by the way,

76
00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:32.550
如果你是被迫做的，怎么做得这么好，
if you are forced to do it, how to do so well,

77
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.659
如果框架为您做出了选择，他们中的许多人都做了。
if that framework makes that choice for you and many of them have.

78
00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.110
你还能有效率吗？或者你只是要戴着眼罩编写代码？
Can you still be effective or you're simply gonna be coding with blinders on?

79
00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.090
这是JavaScript语言的三大核心支柱
So these are the three core pillars of the JavaScript language and

80
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.488
基本上所有这些柱子都在10天结束时就位
largely all of these pillars were in place at the end of the 10 day

81
00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.990
布伦达和我在1995年举行的原型会议。
prototyping session that Brenda and I put back in in 1995.

82
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.350
这在很大程度上是我们已经使用了24年的JavaScript。
This is largely the JavaScript that we've had now for 24 years.

83
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.040
是的，肯定有不同的细节。
Yes, there are definitely different details.

84
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.589
但这些事情中的许多都是核心和
But many of these things are as core and

85
00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.620
基础的根，因为它在语言中。
root of a foundation as it gets in the language.

86
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.779
在本课程结束时，它将涵盖大约两天的时间，
At the end of this course which will cover over a period of about two days,

87
00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.550
感觉就像我们刚过了五个月或者
it's going to feel a lot more like we just went over five or

88
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.129
十天的材料，因为它是非常压缩的。
ten days worth of material because it's extremely compressed.

89
00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.410
所以我不是想让你在这门课结束时说，啊哈，我有资格，
So I don't mean for you to come at the end of this course and say, aha I'm certified,

90
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.649
我知道关于JavaScript的一切，这不是结束，但是
I know everything there is to know about JavaScript, this is not the end but

91
00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:30.529
为什么的开始
the beginning of what for

92
00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.980
我已经花了20年的时间来理解JavaScript。
me has been over a 20 year journey to understand JavaScript.

93
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.439
我正在为你记录我对地图的理解。
And I'm documenting for you what I've figured out about the map.

94
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.560
我试着为我的旅途拼凑出一张藏宝图。
I've tried to put together a treasure map for my journey.

95
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.990
我为你们记录了这一点，这也是书的内容。
And I'm documenting that for you, that's also what the books are.

96
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.409
所以在这里用它们作为伴侣。
So use those as companions here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.084
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：为了理解我想要的东西
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So to understand that thing that I would like there to be in

2
00:00:03.084 --> 00:00:06.878
中间，我们面临的全有或全无的难题，
the middle, the all or nothing sort of conundrum that we're facing,

3
00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:10.960
我想更具体地探究一下这些利弊。
I wanna dig into those pros and cons a little bit more specifically.

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.560
这些只是我对利弊的看法，这不是什么客观的清单。
These are just my takes on the pros and cons, this is not some objective list.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.652
第一，我认为打字和流程这样的系统最大的优点之一，
Number one, I think one of the big pros about systems like TypeScript and Flow,

6
00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:25.292
我之前说过，它们使类型在您的代码中更加明显。
I said this earlier, they make the types much more obvious in your code.

7
00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.789
这是一个很大的进步。
And that's a big improvement.

8
00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.357
与编写本质上完全不确定的代码相比，这是一个很大的改进，
A big improvement over writing code that's essentially completely uncertain,

9
00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:36.369
无法确定这次行动会发生什么。
unascertainable what's gonna happen with this particular operation.

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.049
让这些类型变得明显是一件好事。
Making those types obvious is a good thing.

11
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:46.710
这也是一个很强的积极作用，打字稿的设计和
It's also a very strong positive that the design of TypeScript and

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.799
流动，把双关语放在这里，随波逐流，
Flow, to put a pun here, goes with the flow,

13
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.920
如果你愿意，看看静态类型在许多其他语言中的工作方式。
if you will, of the way static typing works in a lot of other languages.

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.738
语法非常相似。
The syntaxes are very similar.

15
00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:59.709
所以有一种强烈的熟悉感。
And so there's a strong sense of familiarity.

16
00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.277
当你出现在这样的事情上，你并不是完全不同的
When you show up to something like that, you're not in this entirely different

17
00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:05.790
世界比你以前做过的类型更多。
world than you've ever done with types before.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.739
它感觉非常像你从更多的
It feels very much like the types that you have from a more

19
00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.750
典型的类型化语言，如Java或C+。
typically typed language, like a Java or C++.

20
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.430
所以熟悉是一个很强的专业，我相信这是他们设计的一部分。
So the familiarity is a strong pro, and I'm sure that was part of their design.

21
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.034
他们非常受欢迎。
They are extremely popular.

22
00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:25.799
不可否认，尤其是打字稿的受欢迎程度。
It's undeniable the popularity, especially of TypeScript.

23
00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.519
似乎每天我们都会收到一些新的主要开放源码的公告
It seems like everyday we get an announcement of some new major open source

24
00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:32.710
完全转换成打字稿的项目。
project that's completely converting over to TypeScript.

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.527
就像在某件事背后在社区中建立起来的炒作曲线一样
And just like the hype curves that build up in the community behind something

26
00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:42.641
就像REACT或VUE一样，他们以如此强大的方式建立起来，有很大的支持，
like a React or a Vue, they've built up in such a strong way, with a big backing,

27
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:46.650
打字稿来自微软，流量来自Facebook。
TypeScript being from Microsoft, Flow being from Facebook.

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.388
他们与社区建立了如此庞大的关系
They've built up in such a big way with the community and

29
00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:52.651
它背后的企业支持，学习和学习的投资
the corporate support behind it, that the investment to learn and

30
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:56.810
进入其中一个将会是一项长期回报的投资。
get into one of those is gonna be an investment that pays off for a long time.

31
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.530
下周不是什么时尚会消失。
It's not some fad that's gonna go away next week.

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.030
因此，受欢迎程度是一个强大的诉求。
So the popularity is a strong suit.

33
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.774
它背后有一个很大的社区，有大量的文档，
There's a big community behind it, a ton of documentation,

34
00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:09.170
这些项目背后蕴藏着巨大的动力，这当然是有意义的。
a ton of momentum behind these projects, and it certainly does make sense.

35
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.503
其实我绝对会说，不管我喜欢不喜欢打字稿，
In fact, I would absolutely say, whether I liked TypeScript or not,

36
00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:16.882
你在一个系统里工作对我来说是愚蠢的，
it would be silly to me for you to be working in a system,

37
00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:21.800
假设您在Microsoft.NET商店工作，并且整天在后端编写C#，
say you worked in a Microsoft .NET shop and you wrote C# all day on the backend,

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.199
然后你需要做一些JavaScript。
and then you needed to do some JavaScript.

39
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.453
我无法想象你不会使用打字稿的情况。
I can't imagine a scenario where you wouldn't use TypeScript.

40
00:02:28.453 --> 00:02:32.177
因为心理环境的转换，我一直在类型的世界和
Cuz the mental context switching of, I've been in types world and

41
00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:35.979
现在我在非类型的世界里，会让我发疯的。
now I'm in non-types world, would be nuts to me.

42
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.966
因此，有很多情况下，它是完全有意义的。
So there's lots of scenarios where it makes completes sense.

43
00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.979
它的受欢迎程度，这就是它不断增长的原因。
And the popularity of that, that's the reason why it's growing.

44
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.639
他们非常老练，这使他们非常擅长自己的工作。
And they're very sophisticated, and that makes them really good at what they do.

45
00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.711
我真的有点惊讶于有多少像打字稿或者
I'm actually kind of amazed at how much something like TypeScript or

46
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:55.991
流可以从我甚至故意试图混淆的代码中推断出来，并且
Flow can infer from code that I even intentionally try to obfuscate, and

47
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:58.879
他们仍然能够搞清楚这些事情。
they're still able to figure those things out.

48
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.009
这些工具在这方面很棒。
These tools are fantastic at that.

49
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:07.770
所以这些都是很强的优点，但我也有一些强烈的负面影响。
So these are all strong pros, but I also have some strong negatives against them.

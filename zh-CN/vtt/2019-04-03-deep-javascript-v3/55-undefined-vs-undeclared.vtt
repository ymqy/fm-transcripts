00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.149
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：让我们确保我们完全清楚这个未定义的整体
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's make sure we're fully clear on this whole undefined

2
00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.209
对未申报的东西。
versus undeclared thing.

3
00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.349
可能会对你们中的一些人进行审查，但让我们确保我们完全清楚。
Might be review for some of you but let's just make sure we're fully clear.

4
00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.810
未定义和未声明之间的区别是什么？
What is the difference between undefined and undeclared?

5
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.752
有人吗？
Anyone?

6
00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.144
&gt；&gt；Speaker 2：您正在声明此变量存在，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're declaring this variable exist,

7
00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.469
我没有给它赋值，但它存在。
I'm not assigning it a value but it exist.

8
00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.211
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：好的，这是真的。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, that's true.

9
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt；&gt；Speaker 2：这里声明了但没有定义。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So there it's declared but not defined.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.785
凯尔·辛普森：好的。
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay.

11
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:26.472
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：未声明。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undeclared.

12
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.384
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：好的，这是其中的一部分，你在正确的轨道上，但是
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, that's part of it, you're on the right track but

13
00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:30.620
还没完呢。
that's not all of it yet.

14
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.491
&gt；&gt；扬声器3：未声明的在此期间从未分配过内存
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undeclared has have never had the memory allocated during

15
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.390
编译器解析阶段而未定义。
the compiler parsing stage whereas undefined.

16
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.920
也许它被分配了，但从来没有分配给它的值。
Maybe it was allocated but there's never been a value assigned to that.

17
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.560
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：将两者
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Putting both of

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.729
把你的答案放在一起，我们就能得到完整的答案。
your answers together we can get the complete answer.

19
00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:48.679
让我重申一下。
So let me restate that.

20
00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.719
你们都是对的。
You are both correct.

21
00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.990
你在正确的轨道上，所以让我重申这一点。
You're on the right track so let me restate this.

22
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.579
这两者之间的差异，未定义意味着变量存在，但是
The difference between these two, undefined means a variable exists but

23
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.189
目前它没有价值。
at the moment it has no value.

24
00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:02.640
它可能从来没有值，也可能曾经有值，但它没有
It may have never had a value or it might have used to have a value and it doesn't

25
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.280
再也没有了，但是在真空的空间里没有其他的价值，它是不确定的，对吗？
anymore but there is no other value in the vacuum of space it is undefined, right?

26
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.579
未声明，即使它们听起来像同义词，未声明实际上是
Undeclared even though they sound like synonyms undeclared is actually

27
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.359
从未在我们访问过的任何范围内正式声明。
never formally declared in any scope that we have accessed to.

28
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.099
这就是未申报的意思。
That's what undeclared means.

29
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:22.868
我们没有它的大理石。
We do not have a marble for it.

30
00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:28.438
在严格模式下，它总是导致那些参考区域，好吗？
And in strict mode, it always results in those reference areas, okay?

31
00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:32.039
保持笔直很重要。
It's important to keep those straight.

32
00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.974
不幸的是，JavaScript试图扰乱这一点，并假装
Unfortunately, JavaScript tries to mess around with this and pretend that

33
00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:40.031
UNDEFINATED与UNDEFINED和它的一些错误消息是一样的
undeclared is sort of the same thing as undefined and some of its error messages

34
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:43.989
以及其他的输出和事情，而不是从历史上看是一个非常糟糕的主意。
and other outputtings and things and not is historically a really bad idea.

35
00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.280
我们需要将这两个概念分开。
We need to keep these two concepts separate.

36
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.930
有一种不同的东西是不存在的，
There's a different something being undeclared doesn't exist,

37
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.640
因为没有定义，所以它确实存在，但没有价值。
and being undefine definitely it does exist, but doesn't have a value.

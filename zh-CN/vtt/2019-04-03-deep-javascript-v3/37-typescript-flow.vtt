1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt；&gt；演讲者1：所以领导整个讨论，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So leading this entire discussion,

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.299
我们一直在说我们想知道我们的类型。
we've been saying that we want to know our types.

3
00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.539
我们想要使用一种编码风格，使我们的类型更加明显。
We want to use a coding style that makes our types more obvious.

4
00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.929
到目前为止，我只使用了我们所知道的JavaScript来做这件事。
And up to this point I've been using only what we know about JavaScript to do that.

5
00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.410
我一直在建议我们可以限制可以进来的价值观的种类
I've been suggesting that we can restrict the kinds of values that can come in for

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.820
例如，类型比较。
type comparisons, for example.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.022
我认为这是一个有效的
And I think that is a valid and

8
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.795
值得的方法，将提高您的代码质量。
worthwhile approach that will improve the quality of your code.

9
00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.022
不管你是喜欢还是
Regardless of whether you like or

10
00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:33.560
不喜欢目前的趋势，这些打字系统，如打字稿和流动。
dislike the current trend towards these typing systems like TypeScript and Flow.

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.890
我要说的是更广泛的类别，类型感知衬里。
And I'm gonna say in a broader category, type-aware linting.

12
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:43.527
正如我们前面所说的，衬里本质上是一种工具，它适用于以下几个方面的观点
As we said earlier, linting is essentially a tool that applies an opinion about

13
00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:47.990
你的代码和给你的意见，以便你可以决定，你知道吗？
your code and gives you that opinion so that you can decide, you know what?

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.677
我同意我不应该那样做。
I agree I shouldn't do that.

15
00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:53.527
我的短裤捕捉到了所有我不想做的事情，而且
My linter catches all kinds of things that I don't wanna do, and

16
00:00:53.527 --> 00:00:55.462
我很高兴我的林特抓住了它。
I'm glad my linter catches it.

17
00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.530
我非常赞成衬里的想法。
I'm very much pro the idea of linting.

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.969
就像我说的，我只支持可配置的链接，
As I said, I'm only pro linting that is configurable,

19
00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.661
然而，因为没有一个大小适合所有人。
however, because there is not a one size fits all.

20
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:10.370
现在，我不像你们中的许多人那样处于这样的情况下，你们是在一个团队中。
Now, I'm not in the situation like many of you are, where you're on a team.

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.650
但即使是在做这个决定的时候，
But even with respect to making that decision,

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.180
您应该仍然能够让团队以民主的方式做出决定。
you should still be able to have the team decide democratically.

23
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.000
而不是团队只能挑选
Rather than the team only be able to pick

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.430
世界上所有其他团队都做过的事情。
what every other team in the entire world has done.

25
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
更好的是团队可以决定什么对他们有效，并且
It's still better that the team could decide what works for them, and

26
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.340
团队中的个别成员对这是什么有发言权。
that the individual members of the team get to have a say-so in what that is.

27
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.680
我们称之为风格指导。
We call that style guidance.

28
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.270
这是个古老的学期。
That's an old school term.

29
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.400
您的团队需要一个风格指南，并且
Your team needs a style guide, and

30
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.420
每个人都应该在风格指南中投票。
everybody should have a vote in the style guide.

31
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.865
我不喜欢和团队一起工作，还有一些
I don't like it when I go and work with a team, and there's some

32
00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:48.234
团队中的仁慈的独裁者为每个人做了所有的决定。
benevolent dictator on the team that has made all the decisions for everybody.

33
00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.108
人们在休息的时候来找我
And people come up to me during the breaks and

34
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:53.689
他们就像我害怕尝试这个因为他会拒绝我的请求。
they're like I'm scared to try this cuz he's gonna reject my pull request.

35
00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.250
这不是一个健康的文化。
That's not a healthy culture.

36
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.200
每个人都应该对你的团队有发言权，而不是我。
Everybody should get a say-so in what works for your team, not me.

37
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.195
你和你的团队成员应该说。
You and your team members should get to say.

38
00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.240
&GT；&GT；演讲者1：所以广义地说，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So broadly speaking,

39
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.550
我经常遇到这样的问题：你对打字稿有什么看法？
I get a lot of times this question of what do you think about TypeScript??

40
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:16.280
嗯，我对打字稿的看法和我对流程的看法是相似的，
Well, what I think about TypeScript and what I think about Flow are similar,

41
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.579
我很高兴它们的存在，即使我不使用它们。
which is I'm glad that they exist even though I don't use them.

42
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:25.759
我不使用打字稿，也不使用流程，我曾经告诉人们
I don't use TypeScript and I don't use Flow, and I used to tell people

43
00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.550
我不这么做的原因是因为他们解决了我没有的问题。
the reason I don't do that is because they solve problems that I don't have.

44
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.020
我现在对此有不同的看法，
I have a different perspective on that now,

45
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.620
一种最近发展起来的观点。
a perspective that has evolved recently.

46
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.819
这并不是说我不使用它们是因为我没有
It is not the case that I don't use them because I don't have

47
00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.280
他们解决的同样的问题，这不是恰当的说法。
the same problems that they solve, that's not the appropriate way to say it.

48
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.969
我不用那些工具或者不喜欢那些工具，
I don't use those tools or don't prefer those tools,

49
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.810
因为他们修复问题的方式让我的代码变得更糟。
because they're fixing the problems in a way that I think makes my code worse.

50
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.969
问题是存在的，正如我在我们讨论的这个单元中一遍又一遍地说过的，
Problems exist, as I have said over and over again in this unit of our discussion,

51
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.780
如果您正在编写代码，而对类型一无所知，那么这就是一个问题。
it is a problem if you are coding and not knowing anything about your types.

52
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.534
这是一个问题，我们应该解决这个问题。
That is a problem and we should solve that problem.

53
00:03:05.534 --> 00:03:11.360
只是我对如何解决这个问题有不同的看法，你和我一起吗？
It's just that I have a different opinion on how to solve it, you with me?

54
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.669
所以在我和你讨论解决方案之前，
So before I talk to you about a solution,

55
00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.270
让我们看看TypeScript和Flow可以为我们做些什么。
let's look at what TypeScript and Flow can do for us.

56
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.250
一般说来，它们的好处是什么？
What are their benefits, broadly speaking?

57
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.979
我明白这是一个非常精简的论点，
I understand that this is a very sort of reduced argument,

58
00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.599
有一个更加复杂和生动的生态系统。
there is a much more complex and vivid ecosystem.

59
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.135
我的意思不是以任何方式来谈论这些，有一个完整的课程
And I don't mean in any way to talk down about these, there's a whole course on

60
00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:38.149
前端大师，甚至可能不止一个，关于打字脚本。
Frontend Masters, or maybe even more than one, about TypeScript.

61
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.920
这些都是伟大的工具，背后有神奇的、聪明的人。
These are great tools with fantastic, intelligent people behind them.

62
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.300
但从广义上讲，它们在生态系统中处于什么位置？
But just sort of broadly speaking, where do they fit within the ecosystem?

63
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.042
他们会为我们做什么？
What are they gonna do for us?

64
00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:50.847
好的，第一，他们会发现与类型相关的错误，
Well, number one, they're gonna catch type-related mistakes,

65
00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:52.610
这是件好事。
that's a good thing.

66
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.969
我们需要帮助发现与类型相关的错误。
We need help catching our type-related mistakes.

67
00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.009
我希望有一个工具能够理解我想用类型做什么，并且
I would like to have a tool that understood what I wanna do with types, and

68
00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.879
帮我找出我什么时候做错了。
helped me figure out when I didn't do that correctly.

69
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.009
那会让我成为一个更好的程序员。
That would make me a better coder.

70
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.939
第二，它们确实传达了类型意图，因为类型在代码中。
Number two, they do communicate type intent, because the typing is in the code.

71
00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.620
当然，他们有模式，他们只做推理。
Course they have modes where they are doing only inference.

72
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.689
但本质上，打字稿的最大卖点是
But essentially, the big selling point of TypeScript and

73
00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:21.220
流程是您可以将这些类型批注直接分层在代码的顶部。
Flow is that you can layer these type annotations directly on top of the code.

74
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.300
在某些方面，你这么做的最大原因之一是因为
And in some respects, one of the biggest reasons why you do that is because

75
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.290
它会让你的代码更明显。
it's gonna make your code more obvious.

76
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.324
嗯，我可以清楚地看到这个东西是一个整数，
Well, I can clearly see that that thing is an integer,

77
00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:31.149
或者那东西是一根绳子，对吧？
or that thing is a string, right?

78
00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.649
那很好。
That's good.

79
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:36.139
第三，我认为这一点经常被忽视，但是
Number three, and I think this is often overlooked, but

80
00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.340
也许是最大的事情之一。
maybe one of the biggest things.

81
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.829
是通过这样做，
Is that by doing so,

82
00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:43.649
通过选择加入这个系统，你会得到一个惊人的数量
by choosing to opt into that system, you get an amazing amount

83
00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:48.060
通过工具生态系统可以直接显示在您的ID中的反馈。
of feedback through the tooling ecosystem that can show up live directly in your ID.

84
00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.449
太棒了，我看过一些自动完成的
It's awesome, I've seen some of the auto completing and

85
00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.490
像TypeScript这样的东西所做的即时推论和类型分析。
on the fly inferences and type analysis that something like TypeScript does.

86
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.600
在这一点上，TypeScript比Flow要好得多，但是
TypeScript does it a lot better than Flow at this point, but

87
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.120
我相信流量会赶上的，对吧？
I'm sure Flow will catch up, right?

88
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.970
我认为IDE与TypeScript集成
I think IDE integration with TypeScript

89
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.839
比我见过的任何集成在IDE中的项目都要好，这太棒了。
is better than any project that I've ever seen integrated in an IDE, it's fantastic.

90
00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.250
我碰巧没有使用IDE。
I happened to not use IDEs.

91
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.012
所以我碰巧没有从中受益，但是
So I happened to not benefit from any of that, but

92
00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:16.432
这并不意味着我不尊重它，我认为它太棒了。
that doesn't mean I don't respect it, I think it's fantastic.

93
00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.750
&gt；&gt；扬声器1：这些工具有一些注意事项。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There are some caveats to these tools.

94
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.139
第一，你所依赖的推理
Number one, the inferencing that you rely upon, which you

95
00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.555
当你有一个不打算注释的地方时，就依赖于推理。
rely upon inferencing whenever you have a place where you're not gonna annotate.

96
00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:33.348
[笑]你所依赖的推理真的只是一个最好的猜测。
[LAUGH] The inferencing that you rely on really is just a best guess.

97
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.965
不是坚如磐石。
It's not rock solid.

98
00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:40.519
我们在编译时尽可能多地猜测一些东西。
We're guessing something as much as we can at compile time.

99
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.601
我们真的不知道在运行时会发生什么。
We don't really know what's actually gonna happen at run time.

100
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:50.702
实际上，这是从第二个开始的，因为注释是可选的。
That flows from number two actually, because the annotations are optional.

101
00:05:50.702 --> 00:05:54.720
这意味着您团队中的开发人员，如果他们不在
Which means the developers on your team, if they don't put an annotation on

102
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.259
变量typescript将默认为any类型，除非您将其关闭。
a variable, TypeScript will default to the any type unless you have that turned off.

103
00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.100
它将默认为ANY类型，然后您将无法从中获得任何好处。
It will default to the any type and then you're not getting any benefit out of it.

104
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.389
所以它是一个选择加入的系统。
So it is an opt-in system.

105
00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.870
如果你不选择一个特定的地方，你只能得到最好的猜测。
And if you don't opt in in a particular place you're only getting a best guess.

106
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.235
它可能会导致一种错误的安全感，如果你
It can lead to a false sense of security if you're

107
00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:16.447
对你的用法不是很小心。
not being very careful about your usage of it.

108
00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:23.250
&gt；&gt；演讲者1：这来源于我一直在说的话。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This flows from really what I've been saying the whole time.

109
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.420
任何未键入的地方，无论是在您的代码中还是在您的代码中
That any place that isn't typed, either in your code or

110
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.050
您的代码涉及的内容不在您的应用程序中。
things that your code touches that are not in your application.

111
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.240
如果没有打字，就会有不确定性。
If they aren't typed there is uncertainty.

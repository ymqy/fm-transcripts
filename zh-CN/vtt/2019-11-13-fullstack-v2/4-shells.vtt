00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:04.070
> > Jem Young: 现在我们来谈谈贝壳。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
now we'll talk about shells.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.647
什么是 shell?
What is a shell?

3
00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:07.339
我给你个提示
I'll give you a hint.

4
00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.960
你刚刚用了五秒钟
You just used one five seconds ago.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.199
嗯。
Yes.

6
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.949
>> 扬声器 2: Bash。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bash.

7
00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:12.919
>> Jem Young: 是的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

8
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.160
>> 扬声器 2: 缺省情况下包含在许多 Unix 系统中的扬声器，但是
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the one that's included
with a lot of Unix systems by default, but

9
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.390
它基本上允许您运行命令行。
it basically allows you
to run command lines.

10
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.320
和 Unix一起运行很多基本的系统。
And run a lot of the basic systems
that that come along with Unix.

11
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.910
>> Jem Young: 正确的答案。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly right, good answer.

12
00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.090
Shell 只是用于与系统接口的命令解释器。
The shell is just a command interpreter
to interface with a system.

13
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.439
就像我说的 80 年代的 80 年代我正在和我自己约会
Like I said, in the old days, the 80s,
[LAUGH] I'm dating myself now.

14
00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.450
这不是很久以前你所拥有的
Not that long ago, that's all you had.

15
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.479
当你坐在电脑上的时候你就把这个眨眨了
You just had this blinking cursor
when you sat down on a computer and

16
00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.670
真的是恐吓和人，我做什么 ?
is really intimidating and
people are, what do I do?

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.585
不容易找到可以运行的命令。
There's no easy way to figure
out which commands you can run.

18
00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.158
Heck，你可能都不知道你刚坐的是哪个操作系统
Heck, you probably didn't even know which
operating system you're on if you just sat

19
00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:54.960
在一个随机的计算机上
down on a random computer.

20
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.051
但贝壳只是跟操作系统说话的一种方式
But shells are just a way
of talking to the OS,

21
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:00.350
与其他与系统交谈的应用程序交谈。
to talk to the other applications
talking to the system.

22
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.929
终端是我们在这里的应用。
The terminal is the application
that we're in here.

23
00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.609
所以我正在运行 iTerm ，它很受欢迎。
So I'm running iTerm which
it's pretty popular.

24
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.890
有些人可能有点不同
Some of you are probably
running something different.

25
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.060
如果您正在使用 Windows ，那么可能正在使用 PowerShell 或类似的内容。
If you're using Windows, you're probably
using PowerShell or something like that.

26
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.549
但终端只是外壳上的包装器
But Terminal it's just a wrapper
on shell applications.

27
00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.629
一些较为流行的应用是 Bash，
And some of the more popular
shell applications are Bash,

28
00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.340
这才是我们今天用的
that's what we're using today.

29
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.569
也许我们会再检查一次
Probably, we'll check in a second.

30
00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.349
扎克是个很受欢迎的人
ZSH is a really popular one.

31
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.539
还有，我不去所有这些，因为它们不相关。
There's more, I won't go into all of
them because they're not relevant.

32
00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.870
但 Bash 是你最常看到的最主要的
But Bash is the primary one that
you're probably gonna see most often.

33
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.304
而且在你需要的每个操作系统上。
And it's on every operating
system that you need.

34
00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:45.498
>> Jem Young: 而且，就像我之前说的，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And, like I've said before,

35
00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:49.129
外壳就是那个最前线的界面
the shell is just that
frontline that's the interface.

36
00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:52.900
它是一个用户界面，它只是与一个应用程序或操作系统进行对话。
It is a user interface of sorts, and
it just talks to an application or the OS,

37
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.236
是与内核的对话
which talks to the kernel.

38
00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.960
内核是操作系统的核心。
And the kernel is the core
of the operating system.

39
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.549
这就是做所有工作的事情，它与实际机器层对话。
That's the thing that does all the work,
it talks to the actual machine layer.

40
00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.530
所以使用这个外壳的伟大之处在于我们没有远离
So the great thing about using the shell
is we're not that far removed from

41
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.290
在下面运行的实际代码
the actual code that's running underneath.

42
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.250
Versus 是一个 GUI ，它是除去的几个步骤。
Versus a GUI which is
a few more steps removed.

43
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.650
因为这通常会在某种形式上与外壳交谈
Because that's usually gonna talk
to the shell in some sort or

44
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.680
以这种方式运行命令。
run commands in that way.

45
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.719
如果要显示您所使用的 shell ，那么可以输入， echo $0。
If you wanna show the shell that
you're in, you can type, echo $0.

46
00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:24.800
所以，让我们现在来尝试，回声，它会重复我的意思。
So let's try that now, echo,
which echo just repeats what I'm saying.

47
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.270
我要它说 $ 0， $ 只是一个扩展，它扩展了 0 变量。
I want it to say $0, $ is just an
expansion and that expands the 0 variable.

48
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.219
它说我们在巴什
And it says we're in bash.

49
00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.039
如果你不在巴什你应该告诉我
If you're not in Bash,
you should let me know.

50
00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.965
你可能是在巴什人除非有人告诉你要下载些什么
You're probably in Bash though, unless
someone told you to download something,

51
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:38.768
你应该用 SH
you should use the SH.

52
00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:40.302
这就更酷了
It's way cooler, which,

53
00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:44.596
我也不会再讨论今天的辩论了
again, I'm not gonna get into that
debate today about which one is better.

54
00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:46.189
但我们会用巴什的标准
But we'll use Bash because
it's standardized.

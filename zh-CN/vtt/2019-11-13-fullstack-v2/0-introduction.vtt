00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.556
>> Jem Young: 我们正在为前端 V2 执行完整堆栈。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We're doing Full Stack for
Front-End V2.

2
00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:05.083
我从 V1开始就有几年了
It's been a couple of years since V1.

3
00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:08.509
你可能在想，服务器上的变化是什么 ?
And you're probably wondering,
what has changed on the server?

4
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.544
没有多少，这就是服务器的伟大。
Not much,
that's what's great about the server.

5
00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.031
服务器不会让你失望的
The server won't let you down.

6
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:13.605
服务器不更改。
The server doesn't change.

7
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.428
我有台服务器 10 年前还在运行
I have a server still
running from ten years ago.

8
00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:18.032
我更新了但就是这样
I update it, but that's it.

9
00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.076
我什么都没做
I don't do anything else to it.

10
00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:22.650
我打赌我们不能对你的前端应用说同样的话
I bet we can't say the same
thing about your front-end app.

11
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.724
一点都不真实
Not true at all.

12
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:27.204
我也不喜欢前端，很明显，我也做前端的。
I'm not bashing front-end, obviously,
cuz I do front-end as well.

13
00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:31.532
但我说的是满满的是它的位置
But I'm saying full stack,
it's where it's at.

14
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:32.774
我叫杰姆 - 扬
My name is Jem Young.

15
00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.822
我是 Netflix公司的高级软件工程师。
I am a senior software
engineer at Netflix.

16
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:38.165
> > Jem Young: 我的妻子是创造性的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: My wife is the creative one.

17
00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:40.735
于是她编辑了这张照片
So she edited this photo.

18
00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:43.878
那是我去年的万圣节服装我没穿
That was my Halloween costume for
last year that I didn't get to wear.

19
00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:46.463
我希望我今年能穿上它
I'm hoping I get to wear it this year.

20
00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.012
我们会看到的我们会看到的
We'll see, we'll see.

21
00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:52.637
我还做的一件事就是我在播客 " 前端快乐小时"
One of the things I also do is I'm on
a podcast called Front End Happy Hour.

22
00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:54.558
我们已经做了好几年了
We've been doing it several years now.

23
00:00:54.558 --> 00:01:00.093
我这么做他是我的经纪人现在他只是 Netflix的另一个人
I do it with, he was my manager,
now he's just another guy at Netflix.

24
00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.301
还是一个经理，我只是有个不同的经理。
Still a manager,
I just have a different manager.

25
00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:07.263
我们喝了酒谈正事，主要是这个，
And we have drinks and we talk about
front end stuff, and mainly this,

26
00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:11.143
但在较短的时间里还有更多的酒
but for shorter periods of time and
with more alcohol.

27
00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:12.740
所以这很有趣
So it's pretty entertaining.

28
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.649
>> Jem Young: 如果你想看今天的幻灯片
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: If you wanna
see the slides today and

29
00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.625
这种情况是在 jemyoung.com/fsfe上
kind of keep up,
it's at jemyoung.com/fsfe.

30
00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.302
那是满满的堆栈前端
That's full stack front-end.

31
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:29.542
上次我把满满的都搞糊涂了，连我都混了
Last time I did front-end full stack and
it got really confusing, cuz even I mixed

32
00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:33.117
你应该在正前方的地方
it up, but full stack front-end,
you should be at the right place.

33
00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:36.581
如果幻灯片不是黑色的，您就会以某种方式处理旧的幻灯片。
If the slides are not black,
you're on the old slides somehow.

34
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.348
我不知道你是怎么做到的
I don't know how you got there.

35
00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.691
今天我们要去几个地方
Today we're gonna cover a few parts.

36
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:45.731
第二天我们要用引号来掩饰
And day one we're gonna cover full sack,
in quotes.

37
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:49.372
我们将覆盖命令行，订购炮弹，因特网的运作方式，
We're gonna cover the command line,
order shells, how the Internet works,

38
00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:50.822
我最喜欢的问题之一
one of my favorite questions.

39
00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:52.688
然后我们就会覆盖 VIM
And then we're gonna cover VIM.

40
00:01:52.688 --> 00:01:55.479
我们会不时地休息好吧
We're gonna take breaks from
time to time just because, well,

41
00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.798
我们会学到很多新信息我们会加载这些信息的
we're gonna learn a lot of new information
and we're gonna load up on that.

42
00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:01.468
我不想让任何人超负荷所以我们会不时地休息
And I don't wanna overload anybody, so
we'll take breaks from time to time.

43
00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:06.084
如果我们走得太远或者你需要跟上，就说，嘿，
And if we're going too far or
you need to catch up, just say, hey,

44
00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.578
杰姆我需要休息
Jem, I need a break.

45
00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:09.271
我们要五个，没关系
And we'll take five, that's okay.

46
00:02:12.253 --> 00:02:14.713
>> Jem Young: 什么是完整的堆栈?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: What is full stack?

47
00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:20.348
任何人，任何人，房间里的任何人，你都能告诉我完整的堆栈是什么吗 ?
Anybody, anybody, anybody in the room,
you could just tell me what full stack is?

48
00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.234
什么是全堆工程师
What's a full stack engineer?

49
00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:24.239
>> Jem Young: 没有人。 有些
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No one at all.
Some

50
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.950
你说你是个满满的工程师对吧
of you said you're a full stack engineers,
so, yes?

51
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.567
>> 扬声器 2: 那么，从客户机到
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, everything
from the client all the way up to

52
00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:30.757
服务器 - >> Jem Young: 是。
the server-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

53
00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:32.780
>> 扬声器 2: 数据存储器。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The data stores.

54
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.144
>> Jem Young: 是的， >> Jem Young: 我喜欢这样。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I like that.

55
00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:38.817
完全堆栈的事情是很有争议的。
The thing about full stack
is it's very contentious.

56
00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:41.567
有些人不可能是一个完整的工程师。
There are people that are like it's
not possibly a full stack engineer.

57
00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:43.117
这还不是真的
That's not even a real thing.

58
00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:44.442
显然我不同意
Obviously I disagree.

59
00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:49.105
大部分我不同意布莱恩 - 霍尔特是我的朋友和对手
And mostly I disagree with Bryan Holt,
who is my friend and rival,

60
00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:50.864
苦涩的对手
bitter, bitter rival.

61
00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:53.521
他说这是一个完整的开发者。
[LAUGH] He says this is
a full stack developer.

62
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:55.679
老实说我同意他的说法
And honestly, I agree with him.

63
00:02:55.679 --> 00:03:00.239
我认为在这堆堆的每一部分都是不可能的。
I think it is almost impossible to
be good at every part of the stack.

64
00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.390
你可以在前端做得好，你可以很擅长一些后端的工作。
You can be good at the front-end, you can
be good at probably some of the back-end.

65
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.413
您可能对数据库很有好处。
You might be good at databases.

66
00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:05.384
你可能很安全
You might be good at security.

67
00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.016
您可能很擅长调整性能。
You might be good at performance tuning.

68
00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:11.635
你可能在 3D 动画里很棒但是真的
You might be amazing at 3D animations,
but it's really, really,

69
00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:15.627
真的很难让他们大惊大惊艳
really, really,
really hard to be amazing at all of them.

70
00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:17.000
世界上很少有人会这样做。
There's very few people
in the world that are.

71
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.590
所以如果有部分你不太明白你就会很酷
So if there's parts you don't quite
understand, you're like that's cool but

72
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.090
我不想太沉下去太好了
I don't really wanna dive into
it too much, that's okay.

73
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.170
那应该是这样
That's the way it should be.

74
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.580
找到你热爱的地方然后再去挖掘
Find the area that you're passionate
about and then kind of dig into that and

75
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.923
成为了这方面的专家
become an expert at that end.

76
00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:36.979
>> Jem Young: 但是当我们说，什么是完整的堆，很多正面的工程师，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But when we say, what is
full stack, a lot of frontend engineers,

77
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:43.466
尤其是在前面有个前端，有一个后端。
especially, they're like, well, there's
a frontend, there's a backend somewhere.

78
00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:47.224
然后它一起工作我不知道
And then it works together somehow,
I don't know.

79
00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:49.122
有人刚做了 API 我就给它打了电话
Someone just made an API and I call it.

80
00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:52.091
我从未想过这么多工作的想法
I've never really given it a lot
of thought about how that works.

81
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:57.213
或者你做了很多的后端工作，你的意思是，我制作这些 API 和
Or maybe you do a lot of backend work, and
you're saying, well, I make these APIs and

82
00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:01.862
然后它会以某种方式调用它，然后建立起来，然后它就会走到一起。
then the frontend calls it somehow and
it gets built, and it comes together.

83
00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:04.163
我不知道它就在某种程度上
I don't know,
it just comes together somehow.

84
00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:06.364
这就是我几年前的地方。
And this is where I was a few years ago.

85
00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:07.293
我只是觉得
I just thought, well,

86
00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:09.762
我不需要担心因为我永远不会碰它
I don't need to worry about that
because I'll never touch it.

87
00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:11.789
这不是真的。
And that's not quite true.

88
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.405
在你的职业生涯的某个时刻，你必须在后端工作。
At some point in your career,
you're gonna have to work on the backend.

89
00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:16.086
或者你得在码头工作
Or you're gonna have to
work in the terminal.

90
00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:19.478
或者你得弄明白怎么去做什么
Or you're gonna have to work figure
out how to SSH into something and

91
00:04:19.478 --> 00:04:20.502
查看数据库。
look at a database.

92
00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:22.850
你得学着这些东西
You're gonna have to
learn all these things.

93
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.026
这就是这个课的内容。
And that's what this class is for.

94
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:28.785
>> Jem Young: 为何完整的栈如此定义 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
why is full stack such a hard definition?

95
00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.086
因为前端是很难定义的
Well, because frontend is
hard enough to define.

96
00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:34.215
因此，前端可能是一辆汽车。
So frontend, it could be a car.

97
00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:35.213
汽车有 UIs。
Cars have UIs.

98
00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:37.297
其中一些是用 JavaScript 编写的。
Some of them are written in JavaScript.

99
00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:38.711
它可以是电视
It can be a TV.

100
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.812
显然是浏览器
Browsers, obviously.

101
00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.274
桌面应用，移动设备。
There's desktop apps, mobile devices.

102
00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:44.927
像冰箱之类的电器之类的
There's appliances like refrigerators and
things like that.

103
00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:49.182
我只是在把它作为一个前端的工程师的意思擦去。
And I'm just skimming the surface of
what it means to be a frontend engineer.

104
00:04:49.182 --> 00:04:53.196
很多时候人们会说，嗯，正面是很难的，但是
And a lot of times people say,
yeah, frontend is hard, but

105
00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:56.178
对前方的采访更加困难。
interviewing for frontend is even harder.

106
00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:57.492
这是为什么呢 ?
And it is, and why?

107
00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:58.997
因为这一切
Because of all this.

108
00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:03.286
从字面上来说，前端覆盖了许多不同的用例，这将是
Literally, frontend covers so
many different use cases, which would be

109
00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:07.798
总是很难精确地确定一个定义是什么
frontend, that it's really hard to nail
down exactly what a definition is.

110
00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:10.826
别担心，后端也同样复杂。
And don't fret,
the backend is just as complicated too.

111
00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:13.427
你说我在后端工作
You say, I work on the backend.

112
00:05:13.427 --> 00:05:14.458
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

113
00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:15.928
您可以构建 API。
You could be building APIs.

114
00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:17.511
你可能是数据科学家
You might be a data scientist.

115
00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:18.805
你可以做保安
You might do security.

116
00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:20.584
你可能会承担网络责任
You might do cyber liability.

117
00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:24.665
您可能是某种数据库工程师，数据库管理员。
You might be some sort of database
engineer, database admin.

118
00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:26.339
或者你只是在平台上工作
Or you might just work on the platform.

119
00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:27.648
或者你可以做嵌入式软件。
Or you could do embedded software.

120
00:05:27.648 --> 00:05:30.817
或者你可以做很多被认为是后端的事情。
Or you can do a lot of things
that are considered backend.

121
00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:35.002
但它又不是很硬的定义
But again, it doesn't really
have a hard definition, but

122
00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:40.038
我们喜欢说前端和后端，以帮助区分人员。
we like to say frontend and
backend just to help differentiate people.

123
00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:43.038
所以，我们今天将会学到很多新的东西。
So, again, we're gonna learn
a lot of new things today.

124
00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:46.817
如果你不跟你有什么关系，或者不坚持，别担心，
If something doesn't quite click with
you or doesn't stick, don't worry,

125
00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:48.661
我们今天的事太多了
we're covering so much stuff today.

126
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:54.314
>> Jem Young: 那么，这一天到底是什么呢 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So again,
what is full stack at the end of the day?

127
00:05:54.314 --> 00:05:55.920
我喜欢你的定义
I liked your definition,

128
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.081
这是一个可以从一开始就可以构建应用程序的人。
which is someone who can build
an application from start to finish.

129
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.310
很简单直说吧
Pretty simple, pretty straightforward.

130
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.725
如果我说我想下一个 Netflix的话
It's someone that if I say I
wanna make the next Netflix,

131
00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:10.314
我想下一个脸书那个人
I wanna make the next Facebook,
that person,

132
00:06:10.314 --> 00:06:15.021
我可以给你，然后开始，你就结束了。
I can give it to you, and
then will start and you'll finish.

133
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.721
你会从这个疯狂的想法到终点线
You'll come from this crazy idea
to all the way to the finish line.

134
00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:20.404
这意味着服务器，数据库。
That means the server, the database.

135
00:06:20.404 --> 00:06:23.235
所有这些事情之间的安全
All these things between, security.

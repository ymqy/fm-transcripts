00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
>> Jem Young: 安全是你所做的最重要的事情之一，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Security is honestly one
of the most important things you'll do,

2
00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.000
这与我们作为工程师的工作背道而驰
which kind of run contrary
to what we do as engineers.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.276
我们认为，不，我的工作是造东西，把东西连接起来，
We think, no, my job is to build
things and connect things and

4
00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:14.880
确保管道顺利运行一切都像这样
make sure the pipes are running
smoothly and everything like that.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.910
但安全的问题是什么都没有你的聪明
But the thing about security is none of,
none of your cleverness, none of

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.016
您的代码，如果您没有安全性，那么不会发生任何快速的应用程序问题。
your code, none of your fast application
matters if you have no security.

7
00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:27.378
因为你知道会发生什么 13 岁的孩子
Because you know what's gonna happen,
some 13 year-old is gonna come in and

8
00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:31.233
擦掉你的服务器或者他跟你说我的比特币之类的
wipe your server or he said to you
mine Bitcoin or something like that.

9
00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.189
因为他们能
Why, because they can.

10
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.353
正如我们在我们的博客中看到的一样。
And as we noted when
we looked at our blog.

11
00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:36.808
人们一直在努力
People are trying all the time.

12
00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:39.606
他们现在就在你的服务器上你在想
They're trying right now on your
server and you're thinking,

13
00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.220
我没有什么值得的
I don't have anything worthwhile.

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.393
我要把我的 BitCoins 放在我的服务器上
I'm gonna keep my BitCoins on my server.

15
00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:43.566
希望你不会
Hopefully you don't.

16
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.881
但人们想进入任何地方仅仅因为他们利用它来建造很多
But people wanna get in anyways just
because they use it to build lots of

17
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.637
邪恶的东西或者试图窃取密码信用卡信息
nefarious things or just try to steal
passwords, credit card information,

18
00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:53.825
就像这样
things like that.

19
00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.173
你永远不知道服务器上有什么
You never know what's
gonna be on a server.

20
00:00:56.173 --> 00:00:58.704
所以人们只想知道他们会继续努力
So people just wanna know and
they're gonna keep trying to get in.

21
00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:00.918
因此，安全是我们正在做的最重要的事情之一。
So security is one of the more
important things we're doing.

22
00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:02.454
这就是为什么关于这个的整个章节。
That's why there's
an entire section on this.

23
00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:04.287
尽管它是堆满的工程师
Even though it's full stack engineers,

24
00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:06.650
你可能不会像你想象的那么安全
you probably won't do as
much security as you think.

25
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.528
有专门的人把他们的整个生命奉献给了保安
There's dedicated people that dedicate
their entire lives just doing security and

26
00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.609
行动安全之类的东西
operations, security, things like that.

27
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.531
但这些都是很好的做法。
But these are good practices
to keep in top of mind.

28
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:18.978
所以安全问题就在那儿跳
So the question on security is,
jump there,

29
00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:26.587
如果他们能接触到你的服务器有人会怎么做
what could someone do if they gained
just to access to your server, anybody?

30
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:28.549
如果某个人能够访问您的服务器，那么该怎么办 ?
What could someone do if they
gained access to your server?

31
00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.182
好的盖尔
Yes, Gale?

32
00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:32.384
>> 演讲者 2: 如果您重复使用密码的可怕之处，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you do the horrible
thing of reusing your password,

33
00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:34.897
他们有你的密码
they have your password for other things.

34
00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:38.712
> > Jem Young: 是的，这是一个好的，你觉得更普遍。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, that's a good one and
that's more common you think.

35
00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:42.704
我见过保安专业人员他们的密码
I've seen security professionals that
they have their password taped to their

36
00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:45.147
监控，因为旧习惯很难打破，
monitor, because old
habits are hard to break,

37
00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:47.966
这就是我们为什么不使用这类密码的原因。
which is why we don't even
use passwords in this class.

38
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.543
我们使用 SSH 密钥，因为您可以复用这些密钥，
We use SSH keys because you
while you can reuse those,

39
00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:54.566
你不能偷别人的电脑或设备
you can't steal unless you physically
take someone's computer or their device.

40
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.849
如果用户有权访问您的服务器，还有什么可以做 ?
What else can someone do if they
have access to your server?

41
00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.396
>> 扬声器 3: 将您的站点重定向到它们。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Redirect your site to them.

42
00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:00.501
有趣的地方
Nefarious sites.

43
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.209
>> Jem Young: 是的，他们绝对可以的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, they can absolutely.

44
00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.438
他们可以说，我想 bankofusa.com。
They can say, I want to bankofusa.com.

45
00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:10.554
但实际上并不是网站 bankofusa.com
But it's actually not actually
bankofusa.com to site that looks exactly

46
00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:12.983
因为他们可以复制您的 HTML ， CSS 和 JS。
like it because they can just
copy your HTML and CSS and JS.

47
00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:15.013
每次你输入你的证件
And then everytime you
type in your credentials,

48
00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:16.375
他们只是在玩吧
they're just cyphing that off.

49
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.765
如果你不使用  更好
Even better if you weren't using HTTPS,

50
00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:22.396
他们可以把所有东西都转发到真实的真实地点
they can actually forward
everything to the actual real site.

51
00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:25.695
所以那些跑现场的人不知道它坏了
So that the the people running the site
don't know that it's broken and

52
00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.125
他们只是在偷车之间的交通
they're just stealing all
the traffic in between.

53
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.365
这就是所谓的中间攻击中的男人。
That is actually it's called
a man in the middle attack.

54
00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:35.554
这是非常非常普遍的，在  之前，老实说，这还是很常见的。
And that's very, very common, before HTTPS
and, honestly, it's still far to common.

55
00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:36.917
有更容易的方法来防止这种情况发生。
There's easier ways to prevent that.

56
00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:38.257
还有别人能做什么
What else could someone do?

57
00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.800
有什么事吗
Anything, what else?

58
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.703
嗯。
Yes.

59
00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:43.828
>> 演讲者 2: 他们可以在您的服务器上运行自己的服务器，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They can kind of run
their own server on your server and

60
00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.156
直到你被禁赛
until you get banned.

61
00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:50.020
然后突然之间你的腿不工作了你的 IP 被禁止了
And then all of a sudden, your legit stuff
is not working cuz your IPs are banned

62
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.349
像邮差之类的服务
from services like a mailbot or
something like that.

63
00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.372
比如当人们的桥梁在吐痰世界的时候
Like when people's bridges
were spamming the world.

64
00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:59.252
>> Jem Young: 是的，他们可以将您锁定在自己的服务器之外。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
they can lock you out of your own server.

65
00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:02.721
就像所有数据和你放入的时间和代码一样
So that like all that data and
all that time and code you put in,

66
00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:06.347
他们可以偷它把你锁在外面你不能把它弄回来
they can steal it and lock you out
of it and you can't get it back.

67
00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:09.001
你会说， DigitalOcean 我无法进入自己的服务器。
And you'll say,
DigitalOcean I can't get in my own server.

68
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:10.162
他们会像我们无法进入你的服务器
They'll be like we can't
get in your server.

69
00:03:10.162 --> 00:03:11.754
这就是你的问题伙计
That's on you, pal.

70
00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.485
人们还能做些什么 ?
What else could people do?

71
00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.295
我想听更多马克你有什么事吗
I wanna hear more,
Mark do you have something?

72
00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.590
>> 扬声器 3: 擦除数据库。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Scrape your database.

73
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.776
>> Jem Young: 他们可以刮你的数据库，他们可以把所有
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: They can scrape your
database, they can take all that credit

74
00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:22.838
卡信息或非加密密码 ( 今天) ，
card information or
unencrypted passwords which today,

75
00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:25.792
在数据库中仍然保留未加密的密码。
people still leave unencrypted
password in database.

76
00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:26.895
别那么做
Don't do that.

77
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:30.084
希望你永远不会在你的岗位上
Hopefully, you will never be in that
position where you have to be saving

78
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.192
数据库的密码。
passwords to database.

79
00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:34.442
他们会成为更合格但更有资格的人
They'll be someone who
is more qualified but

80
00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:38.985
互联网的大部分黑客都是被人侵入的
most of the hacks of the internet
were by people who got hacked.

81
00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:44.204
因为像我这样的人知道得够危险的
Because someone like me who knows
enough to be dangerous thought,

82
00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:45.949
我用 MD5 哈希
I’ll use an MD5 hash.

83
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.853
但我只做五次
But I'll just do it five times and

84
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:52.354
我将使用 MD5 的密码来散列密码，这是一个非常易碎的散列机制。
I'll hash a password using MD5 which
is a very breakable hashing mechanism.

85
00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:54.348
我去保存它看起来很安全
And I'll save that and it looks secure.

86
00:03:54.348 --> 00:03:56.582
但因为数据库没有被锁定
But because the database
wasn't locked down and

87
00:03:56.582 --> 00:03:58.389
许可权没有被锁定
the permission weren't locked down.

88
00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.367
他们进了数据库你就没事了
They got into the database and
you are like, it's okay

89
00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:05.794
因为所有东西都是安全的，加密后解密。
because everything is still safe cuz it's
encrypted and then they decrypted that.

90
00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:10.783
坦白说，这种情况往往比你想象的要多。
Honestly and that happens way more
often than you'd like to think.

91
00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:14.502
因为有一个密码能联系到
And because there's
a password reach every other

92
00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:18.317
现在看来都是由于安全问题
day now it seems like it's
all due to bad security.

93
00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:22.379
这就是为什么安全才是真正重要的因为在核心
And that's why security is really,
really important because at the core,

94
00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.298
如果你要去医院或者银行或者我不知道
if you're running a hospital or
bank or I don't know,

95
00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.550
投资公司的人都在你手里
investment company you have
people's lives in your hands.

96
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.540
如果有人偷你的密码就毁了你的生活
Your life can be ruined if someone steals
your password, steals all your money or

97
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.665
就像你付不起租金的那样，权力就会被关起来。
something like that you can't pay rent,
the power gets shut off things like that.

98
00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.413
所以安全真的非常重要。
So security is really, really important.

99
00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:43.098
也许更常见的事情是
What's probably even more
common thing that happens when

100
00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:45.783
人们的服务器被破坏了
people servers get broken into.

101
00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:47.300
这只会有点棘手
This one's a little trickier.

102
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.476
>> 扬声器 2: 已装入请求。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Overloaded with requests.

103
00:04:50.476 --> 00:04:53.071
>> Jem Young: 是的，这就是最终结果，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, so
that's the end result,

104
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:57.728
他们能做的就是把它变成僵尸网络
what they do is they could turn
into what's known as a botnet.

105
00:04:57.728 --> 00:05:01.197
这就是他们安装后门的程序。
And that's just a program
that they install a backdoor.

106
00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:02.346
他们什么都不会做
They won't do anything.

107
00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:06.648
事实上，如果你在 Unix 上真的很棒，你可以删除所有日志。
And in fact, if you're really good in
Unix, you can delete all the logs.

108
00:05:06.648 --> 00:05:08.774
所以有人可以闯进去做些事情
So someone could break in,
do a bunch of stuff,

109
00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:12.139
删除显示它们中存在相当普通的日志的日志。
delete the logs that show that they
ever were there which is pretty common.

110
00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.196
有个剧本会为你做的
There's a script that will do it for you.

111
00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:19.024
然后他们就像个无声的僵尸网
And then they just turn into like a silent
botnet and they might not do anything for

112
00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:20.375
几个月甚至几年
months or even years.

113
00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:24.072
但当时机到来他们可以激活你的服务器
But when it comes time they can
activate your server, shut down all

114
00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:27.908
然后把它变成 DDoSing 的人
the running programs and then turn
that into a way of DDoSing people.

115
00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:31.329
这是分布式拒绝攻击，这意味着我可以将所有服务器和
That's distributed denial of attack, which
means I can take all of my servers and

116
00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:32.024
说的是
point at, say,

117
00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:35.213
netflix.com 并尝试降低已分配的大量流量。
netflix.com and try to take down
assigned level of overwhelming traffic.

118
00:05:35.213 --> 00:05:38.310
绝大多数的黑客服务器都是这样做的。
That is overwhelmingly what
a lot of hack servers do.

119
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.454
一旦他们被侵入了
And then once they're done hacking,

120
00:05:40.454 --> 00:05:43.408
有时它们会完全抹掉你的服务器
sometimes they just wipe
your servers completely.

121
00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:46.848
更滑稽的是我们开始看到更多的
The more nefarious ones,
we're starting to see a lot more,

122
00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:49.560
就是所谓的密码劫机或洗劫
is what is called cryptojacking or
ransoming.

123
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.747
他们会做的就是像你之前说的马克
So what they'll do is,
Mark like you're saying earlier,

124
00:05:52.747 --> 00:05:56.846
他们会窃取你的数据库凭证他们会加密的
they'll steal your database credentials,
they'll encrypt all of them.

125
00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:01.137
他们会对你的整个数据库进行加密
They'll encrypt your entire database
which is, invaluable information and

126
00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:03.552
他们就会把钱卖给你
then they'll sell it back to you for
money.

127
00:06:03.552 --> 00:06:08.189
因为他们加密了它并且他们只有密码
Because they encrypted it and
they only they have the password.

128
00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.242
这种情况经常发生，特别是在医院和整个美国的城镇
That happens a lot, especially with
hospitals and entire towns in America

129
00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:16.038
因为他们还拿走了他们的服务器
are getting a ransom because they
still they took over their server and

130
00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:17.406
把所有东西都加密了
encrypted everything.

131
00:06:17.406 --> 00:06:21.067
所以你可以说我要用数据丢 20年， 30年， 40 年
So at that point, you can say I'm gonna
lose 20, 30, 40 years with the data, or

132
00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.637
我要支付这些人的赎金
I'm gonna pay these people ransom.

133
00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:26.702
没有保证他们不会把其他东西留在你的系统里
And there's no guarantee they didn't leave
others things in your system that will

134
00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:29.096
到三年后你就找不到了
pop up to three years
later that you can't find.

135
00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:30.932
这些都是为了吓唬你
So all that is to scare you, and

136
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:35.033
如果有人在你的服务器上就会很吓人
deliberately cuz it's really scary
if someone gets in your server.

137
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:38.031
现在有人可以获得 root 用户了，它就在游戏结束了。
Now someone gets root access,
it's game over.

138
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.911
你可以用根做任何你想做的事
You can do anything you want with root,

139
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:42.314
所以我们第一件事就是去根除
which is why the first thing
we do is disable root.

140
00:06:42.314 --> 00:06:43.887
但这不是万灵药。
But it's not a cure all.

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.710
>> Jem Young: 好的， Nginx 为我们提供了一个页面。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,
Nginx is serving us a page.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.040
但那是从哪里来的
But where did that come from?

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.679
它在干什么
What is it doing?

4
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.250
我们来看看吧
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.919
那么，让我们看看 Nginx 的配置。
So, let's look at the Nginx configuration.

6
00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.000
而且我们要花很多钱
And we're gonna spend a lot of, well,

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.619
我们要花一段时间在 Nginx 的配置中
we're gonna spend a fair amount of
time in the Nginx configuration.

8
00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:15.868
那就让我们熟悉吧
So, let's get familiar with it.

9
00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:21.347
所以你要做的是什么 ?
So, sudo less or vi or cat or
whatever you want to do,

10
00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:25.958
但在不那么多的 Nginx 网站上
but up for
less etc Nginx sites available and

11
00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:31.082
我们将使用缺省配置。
we're going to use
the default configuration.

12
00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:36.439
记住你可以完成大部分的工作
And remember you can tab
complete most of this.

13
00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:44.304
所以我想说的是更少的 nginx 网站
So I will say sudo less
etc nginx sites-available,

14
00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:48.055
和你的默认值
and default, cool, and

15
00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:52.899
有很多我知道这很多
it's a lot, I know it's a lot.

16
00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.179
Nginx 请在此处提供注释，链接以开始阅读。
Nginx kindly provides comments in here,
links to start reading.

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.689
我现在警告你 Nginx 文件不好看
I'll warn you now the Nginx
documentation is not pretty.

18
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.049
太好了 很明显很彻底
It's good.
It's thorough, obviously,

19
00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.129
但这不是你能理解的最可读性的东西
but it's not the most readable thing
you're ever going to run across.

20
00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:09.890
所以一般来说，如果你说的是微调 Nginx ，最好是做谷歌
So generally, if you're talking about
tweaking Nginx, it's better to do Google

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.180
搜索它并在一个博客上读到一篇关于它的文章。
search on it and read a blog post
on somebody that's talked about it.

22
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.340
几乎所有事都想在内克斯之前做过
Almost everything want to do in
Nginx someone has done before.

23
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.140
所以这是最好的方法。
So that's a better way to go.

24
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.120
但是如果你真的想读博士
However, if you really want to,
read the docs.

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.750
我不推荐这个
I don't recommend it.

26
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.980
你也可以用这个男人的页面，我也不推荐。
You can also use the man page,
I don't recommend that either.

27
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.180
但如果你需要它就在那里
[LAUGH] But it's there if you need it.

28
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.918
我们一会儿再谈这个
And we'll talk more
about that in a second.

29
00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:35.057
>> Jem Young: 所以在 Nginx 的配置下，有很多不同的事情，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So with Nginx configuration
there's a lot of different things,

30
00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:37.659
我今天要强调一下
I'm gonna try to highlight them today.

31
00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:38.650
贝司目录
The bass directory for

32
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.020
所有请求都将转至斜杠 dub dub dub HTML 。
all requests are going to go to
slash var dub dub dub slash HTML.

33
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.659
缺省情况下，所有请求都将进入该位置。
That's where all requests
are going to go by default.

34
00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.329
我们要把这个目录保存在
And we're going to keep that
directory cuz it's just

35
00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.270
好地方把你的东西都留着
the nice place to keep all your web stuff.

36
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.020
如果需要，可以移动，但斜杠 " dub dub dub " 为
You can move around if you want,
but slash var slash dub dub dub is

37
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.939
通常人们把大部分的应用和东西都保留在那里
usually where people keep most of their
applications and things like that.

38
00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.450
但你可以把它移到你想要的地方
But you can move it to wherever you want.

39
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:03.700
一个定位块就是为了
A location block is just saying for

40
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.561
每一个进入服务器的请求，我该怎么办?
every request that comes into the server,
what should I do?

41
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:10.469
还有这里的 Nginx 正则表达式
And Nginx regular expressions here,

42
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.860
在这件事上它只是把一切都准备好了
in this case it's just slash it's
gonna match everything coming in.

43
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.920
它会尝试为这个文件服务所以它会为其中一个提供服务
It's gonna try to serve the file,
so it's gonna serve one of these.

44
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.253
如果没有，就会有 404 页面。
And if it doesn't,
it's just gonna 404 page.

45
00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.449
我们要用这个位置块
We're gonna use the location
blocks slash for

46
00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.000
我们今天要做的事
most of the things we're gonna do today.

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.250
我们不会创建路径或子域之类的。
We're not gonna create paths or
subdomains or things like that.

48
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.280
但这只是个定位块
But that's just called a location block.

49
00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.670
这一尝试强调了文件，这是 Nginx的一个指令。
This try underscore files,
it's what's known as a directive in Nginx.

50
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.050
本质上，它是一个叫做宏做某件事的宏观方法。
Essentially, it's a called a macro for
doing something.

51
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.509
我们待会儿要用的是代理过去
The one we're gonna use a little bit later
is proxy past which we'll talk about.

52
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:45.310
这会将您的请求代理到服务器的其他部分。
And that's gonna proxy your request
to some other part of the server.

53
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.370
但是尝试文件意味着它会尝试查找其中一个文件。
But try files just means it's gonna
try to look up one of these files.

54
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.000
如果它不可能的话就会有 404 页
And if it can't any of them,
it's gonna 404 page.

55
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.969
会说错误的对吧
It's gonna say error, right?

56
00:02:53.969 --> 00:03:00.050
现在，我们在 Nginx 配置中有一个服务器块。
So here we are, we have a server
block in Nginx configuration.

57
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.759
它是缺省服务器，所以它在端口 80上列出。
It's a default server, so
it's listing on port 80.

58
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.389
所有这些东西都在那儿
All this stuff's there.

59
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.618
有一个根目录，服务器名称，稍后我们会更改，
There's a root directory, the server name,
which we'll change later,

60
00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:11.234
但现在我们不需要因为它是默认的服务器
but for now we don't need to
because it's the default server

61
00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.800
仍然接受来自各地的联系
still accepting connections
from everywhere.

62
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.319
这里有个定位块
Here's a location block.

63
00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.930
现在您可以忽略其他部分。
You can ignore the rest of this for now.

64
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.379
这是您的 Nginx 配置。
This is your Nginx configuration.

65
00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.590
所以，让我们微调一下，不要再 q了。
So let's tweak it a little bit and
quit just q.

66
00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.990
所以现在，这个默认页面是来自神奇的神秘土地。
So for now, that default page
came out of magic mystery land.

67
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.599
我们开始创建一个，然后编辑它以更改为您想要的任何内容。
Let's go and create one and then edit
it to change to whatever you want.

68
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.420
它将更改缺省页面，因为这样您就知道您的目录
It's going to change the default page
because that way you know your directories

69
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.090
正在工作，并且文件正在运行，并且正在正常工作。
are working, and the files are working,
and it's serving correctly.

70
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.740
因此， sudo vi/var/www/html ，然后创建 index.html 页面。
So, sudo vi/var/www/html and
then create an index.html page.

71
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.289
所以，我要在这里做。
So, I'm going to go ahead and
do that here.

72
00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.985
须多
Sudo

73
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.389
> > Jem Young: 我知道你在想什么不是合适的 HTML ，不重要。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I know what you're thinking
that's not proper HTML, doesn't matter.

74
00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.460
会有效的
It will work.

75
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.830
如果我想做什么喜欢造型的东西就会坏了
If I try to do anything fancy,
like styling, it's gonna break.

76
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.939
但现在，你不用写一个完整的 HTML 页面。
But for now, you don't have
to write an entire HTML page.

77
00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.060
如果我们有更多的时间，我想说谁能在 10 分钟内创造最佳的 HTML 页面。
If we had more time, I'd say who can
create the best HTML page in 10 minutes.

78
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.074
我觉得我比你还糟
And I feel bad cuz I beat you.

79
00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:23.449
所以，我开玩笑的，我不会的，这不是我的福手。
So, I'm kidding, I wouldn't,
that is not my forte.

80
00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.509
这就是我的专长领域。
This is more my area of expertise.

81
00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.029
但是我们要去 wq
But we're just going to wq that and
when we

82
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.509
在我们现在有另一个页面之前刷新我们的页面，因为
refresh our page before we now have a
different page because instead of looking

83
00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.439
在默认的 Nginx 页面上，在索引点 HTML 中的顺序是有序的。
to that default Nginx page, it's looking
in order in index dot HTML comes in order.

84
00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.259
到目前为止所有人都来了吗
Everybody here so far?

85
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.319
太酷了
Cool.

86
00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.670
现在我们正在做一些事情，我们现在正在为自己的服务器提供一个 HTML 页面。
Now we're doing something, we are now
serving an HTML page on our own server.

87
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.769
我知道些什么
I know little things.

88
00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:50.850
我觉得很酷
I think it's cool.

89
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.350
干得好
Good job.

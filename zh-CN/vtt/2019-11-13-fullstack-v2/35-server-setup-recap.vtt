00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:03.910
> > Jem Young: 那是一次冒险，是一次巨大的冒险。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That was an adventure,
that was a big adventure.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.168
所以希望你有它的承诺你现在可以在这里工作了
So hopefully, you've got it committed,
you can now work on it,

3
00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:10.977
任何人都可以使用它，你可以把你的服务器推给你的心脏内容。
anybody can work on it, you can tweak
your server to your heart's content.

4
00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:14.432
我们做到了，就是第一天。
And we did it, that was day one.

5
00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:18.219
那么， recap，我们学到了什么 ?
So recap, what did we learn?

6
00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.269
我们学会了互联网的运作。
We learned how the Internet works.

7
00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.789
我们学会如何将 IP 连接到一个域，
We learned how to connect an IP
to a domain, to a server,

8
00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.399
到 Web 服务器，到应用程序服务器，并提供数据。
to a web server, to an application server,
and serve out data.

9
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.357
我们学会了如何配置 Nginx ，我们学会了如何配置 Git 。
We learned how to configure Nginx a bit,
we learned how to configure Git a bit.

10
00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:40.359
[LAUGH] 如果需要进一步的浏览，那么可以安装 Fail2ban。
[LAUGH] If you want some further
exploration, you can install Fail2ban.

11
00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.399
Fail2ban，您是否还记得我们如何解决认证日志，以及
Fail2ban, do you remember earlier
how we solve the auth log, and

12
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.329
就像人们总是想进入我的服务器
like people always trying
to get in my server?

13
00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.729
Fail2ban 是一个日志包，本质上它读了很多次尝试，所以
Fail2ban is a log parcel essentially
that it reads a lot of attempts, so

14
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.679
如果有人尝试登录五次无效，就会被禁止
if someone attempts to login five times
it's invalid, it's gonna ban them

15
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.969
所以如果你愿意的话你甚至都不能给你一个有效的登录
completely, so you can't even give
a valid login if you want to.

16
00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.679
这对停止脚本是有用的
And that's useful for
stopping script those

17
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.390
就是下载脚本的人，然后在很多网站上运行这些脚本。
are people that just download scripts and
then run them against lots of websites.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.703
Fail2ban 很有用，我不参加这个课程，虽然我以前是，
Fail2ban is pretty useful, I don't go into
it in this course, even though I used to,

19
00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.963
就因为学习，可能没那么重要。
just because for learning,
it's probably not that important.

20
00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:15.602
但如果你把它送到真正的生产服务器
But if you're sending it for
real production server,

21
00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.519
你就会一直想有 " 故障 " 或类似的东西
you're almost gonna always wanna
have Fail2ban or something similar.

22
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.079
如果你想做快车
And if you wanna do Express,

23
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.200
Express.js 在性能提示方面的站点非常好。
Express.js has a really good
site on performance tips.

24
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.379
它告诉你如何调整一个 Nginx 的位置，如何设置高速缓存，
So it tells you how to tune an Nginx
a bit, how to set up caching,

25
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:27.879
告诉你关于清柒的事
tells you all about varnish,

26
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:32.590
Nginx 高速缓存告诉您如何正确设置标题，类似的内容。
Nginx caching, tells you how to set up
the headers correctly, things like that.

27
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.129
那也就是读书的好，你想和 Express 就开始乱搞了
That's good reading too, if you want
to start messing about with Express and

28
00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.878
你以前没有过
you have not before.

29
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:37.756
但现在我们已经到了最后
But now, we're at the end, so

30
00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:42.308
你现在有更多精力了我现在就在这里
you have a lot more energy now cuz i
started off here and now I'm about here,

31
00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:46.947
因为我每天都是一个晚上 100% 的人，我在晚上做最好的编码。
because I'm a night person a 100% all day,
I do my best coding at night.

32
00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:48.686
有问题吗
Are there any questions?

33
00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:51.729
你想知道更多的事吗
Anything you wanna know more about?

34
00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.990
>> 扬声器 2: 我不知道这是否会花费太多时间，但我除去了
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know if this will
take up too much time, but I removed my

35
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.579
节点模块，现在我在想如何创建该 git 忽略文件?
node modules, and now I'm wondering
how to create that git ignore file?

36
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.802
>> Jem Young: So vi.gitignore。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So vi.gitignore.

37
00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:02.718
>> 演讲者 2:
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

38
00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:05.989
>> Jem Young: 你在那里也有管理吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Did you manage
it there as well, sir?

39
00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:11.937
>> 演讲者 3: 是的，我创造了这个，现在我只是在努力推动。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I created that,
now I'm just stuck trying to push.

40
00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:16.199
>> Jem Young: [LAUGH] 我可以来看看你的电脑
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH]
I may come just look at your computer,

41
00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.289
我们就能看到我们的位置了
we'll see where we're at.

42
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.229
>> 扬声器 2: 然后，我将放置节点模型
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then I would put the node models

43
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.682
在此 - >> Jem Young: 是，
in there-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes,

44
00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:26.110
添加节点下划线模块斜杠- >> 演讲者 2: 斜杠，好吗 ?
you add node underscore modules slash-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Slash, okay?

45
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.605
>> Jem Young: 现在，只要除去这些节点模块，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: For now, as long as
you remove those node modules and

46
00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:33.896
将更改向上推送到 Github，然后添加 git 忽略 firs，
push that change up to Github,
and then add the git ignore firs,

47
00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:36.909
取决于你做的事情
it depends on the order you did things.

48
00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:37.719
>> 扬声器 2: 是，除去它们，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, remove them,

49
00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.069
我加了这个，然后我该 [INAUDIBLE] 吗 ?
I'm adding this, and
then should I [INAUDIBLE] after this?

50
00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.951
>> Jem Young: 是的，让它继续运行。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
to keep it up and running.

51
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:44.045
>> 扬声器 2: 嗯，好的。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.

52
00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.774
> > Jem Young: 那么一点点的回忆，我们学到的不是什么魔法
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So a bit of a recap,
we learned that it's not magic between

53
00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:51.973
前端和后端实际上是大量的胶水工作。
the frontend and the backend,
in fact, it's a lot of glue work.

54
00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:56.050
很多被低估的工作都是由域连接构成的
It's a lot of underappreciated work
that goes from making a domain connect

55
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.104
到服务器，并且该服务器发出应用程序。
to a server, and
that server serve out an application.

56
00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:02.877
事实上，我们学到的是互联网是如何运作的，
And in fact, what we learned
was how the Internet works,

57
00:03:02.877 --> 00:03:08.500
我们发现有一个域通过名称服务器来查找 IP 地址。
we learned that there's a domain that
looks up the IP address via name server.

58
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.060
名称服务器将返回到节点的 IP ，并且节点将关闭，
The name server returns the IP that passes
off to a node, and the node passes off,

59
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.960
把它关了，然后把它关掉，最后击中一个服务器。
and pass it off, and pass it off,
and eventually hits a server.

60
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.229
那台服务器说，我想做些什么呢 ?
That server says, what do I want
do this quest we tried to go?

61
00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.230
然后它会传递到一个 web 服务器，那就是昨天 Nginx 的服务器。
And then it passes off to a web server,
that was server is Nginx yesterday.

62
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.520
然后它就会传递给应用服务器
And then it passes to
an application server,

63
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.300
应用程序服务器是 Express.js，我们都在那里降落。
and the application server was Express.js,
that's where we all landed.

64
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.000
如果你想的是很多话，就做这个，对，就是。
And if you're thinking that was a lot
of words, just do this, yeah, it is.

65
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
但今天我们要用更快速的方法
But today, we're gonna learn
some faster ways of doing this,

66
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.610
我们不必每次都手动执行此操作。
some ways that we don't have to do
this manually every single time.

67
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.676
但就像往常一样，如果你在学习一些东西，那么手动步骤是好的
But as always, if you're learning
something, it's good to go manually step

68
00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:45.822
让你明白我们是怎么做的
by step by step, so
you understand exactly what we do.

69
00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:49.322
昨天我们还学会了一些指挥线路，
Yesterday we also learned
some command line basic,

70
00:03:49.322 --> 00:03:53.620
我们有点眼熟我们没怎么用鼠标
we came a little familiar,
we didn't use the mouse as much.

71
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.800
如果你是个 UI 工程师你应该用鼠标
And if you're an UI engineer,
you probably use the mouse

72
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.639
你每天都能做的最不一样的
the least of all you ever did possible for
an entire day.

73
00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.090
我们还学会了互联网是如何运作的，我们学会了如何创造和
We also learned how the Internet works,
we learned how to create and

74
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.846
管理 Web 服务器，并且我们创建了一个基本的基本节点应用程序。
manage web server, and we created
a pretty basic node application.

75
00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:13.080
今天我们要做一些更先进的事情
Today, we're gonna do things that
are a bit more advanced, and

76
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.225
我有个最后的项目我想这会很有趣的
I have a final projects,
I think it's gonna be pretty fun.

77
00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:20.163
[ INAUDIBLE] 酒店房间点 JS 因为我上次在酒店房间写的
[INAUDIBLE] hotel room dot JS because
I wrote it last time at hotel room,

78
00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:22.716
我想我们会有很多乐趣的
I think we're gonna have
a lot of fun with it.

79
00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:27.081
但现在，我们有了共同的底线，所以我们可以做一些更多的事情，
But now, we have this common baseline,
so we can do things that are a bit more,

80
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.853
我想说有趣的是我不想做第一部分
I wanna say interesting cuz that I
don't wanna make the first part,

81
00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:34.050
看起来有点迟钝但会更先进些
it seem a little dull but
they'll be a bit more advanced.

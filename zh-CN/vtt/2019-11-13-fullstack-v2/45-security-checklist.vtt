00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.910
>> Jem Young: 在安全方面，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: When it comes to security,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.359
我们思考如何锁定我们的服务器有几个关键的方法。
there are a few key ways that we think
about how to lock down our server.

3
00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.521
我们之前谈到的第一个是 SSH，安全的插座外壳。
The first one we talked about before
was SSH, secure socket shell.

4
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.271
因此，我们不使用用户名和密码，而是使用 SSH。
So instead of using a username and
password, we use SSH.

5
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.971
因为用户名密码的问题是，一个，人类，
Because the problem with a username
password is, one, humans,

6
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:23.077
我们会反复重复使用相同的密码。
we tend to reuse the same
password over and over again.

7
00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:27.353
或者，我们将使用密码或密码 1 的变体。
Or we'll use variations of password or
password1.

8
00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:32.048
事实上，安全研究人员，当他们看到被盗的密码时，他们说，
In fact, security researchers, when
they look at stolen passwords, they say,

9
00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.786
最常用的五个常用密码是什么 ?
what are the top five
common stolen passwords?

10
00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:37.347
他们就像 12345
And they're like 12345.

11
00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:40.277
你就像我把密码要求八个字
And you're like, I made my password
requirement eight characters

12
00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:42.015
而不是五个更安全的人
rather than five cuz that's more secure.

13
00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.182
那么人们是做什么的呢 ?
So what do people do?

14
00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:46.087
12345678 .
12345678.

15
00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:50.551
我没开玩笑，如果你看黑密码，会是密码或者
I'm not kidding, if you look at hacked
passwords, it'll be password or

16
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.430
与 @ 符号相反的密码。
password with,
instead of an a, an @ symbol.

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.368
人类我们是自己最糟糕的敌人
Humans, we're our own worst enemy.

18
00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:59.491
我们所做的就是建立这些安全规则
So what we do is we create
these security rules and

19
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:06.046
帮助我们不要用脚射中自己的协议
protocols that help us kind of not shoot
ourselves in our foot, cuz you will.

20
00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:10.305
如果我没告诉你我们可能还会以根为根
If I didn't tell you, we'd probably
still be doing everything as root, and

21
00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:11.426
糟糕的事情就会发生
bad things entail.

22
00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.712
因此，最好遵循社区的最佳实践。
So it's best to follow the best
practices of the community.

23
00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.256
另一种处理安全性的方法，以及
Another way of handling security, and

24
00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:21.192
你可能都熟悉的就是防火墙
the one you're probably all familiar with,
is firewalls.

25
00:01:21.192 --> 00:01:25.061
另一个就是把你的软件保持在最新的状态。
Another one is just keeping
your software just up-to-date.

26
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:29.481
因为漏洞和零天，它们一直在发生。
Because vulnerabilities and
zero days, they happen all the time.

27
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.557
其实零天就有很大的钱。
In fact, there is big money in zero days.

28
00:01:32.557 --> 00:01:34.587
我说零天，但是什么是零日呢 ?
And I say zero days,
but what is a zero day?

29
00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:37.549
我肯定你以前听过这个词
I'm sure you've heard the term before.

30
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.620
>> 扬声器 2: 未修补的漏洞。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Unpatched vulnerability.

31
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.799
>> Jem Young: 这是一个毫无漏洞的漏洞，
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's
an unpatched vulnerability,

32
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.500
尤其是公司本身，所以微软或者
specifically one that the company itself,
so Microsoft or

33
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.400
Apple 或 Google 尚未找到或记录。
Apple or Google,
has not found or documented yet.

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.331
所以它是一个无证件的弱势，零天的价值是一吨的钱。
So it's an undocumented vulnerability,
and zero days are worth a ton of money.

35
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:00.609
我们说的是百万美元取决于利用的是什么
We're talking millions of dollars,
depending on what the exploit is.

36
00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.170
还有那么多的公司
And there's so much so
that there's entire companies

37
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.400
他们所做的就是试着寻找零天然后把它们卖给出价最高的人
that all they do is try to find zero days
and then sell them to the highest bidders.

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.580
这些都是世界上的灰色帽子因为他们就像
These are kind of known as gray hats
in the world, because they're like,

39
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.360
这事我们没做任何坏事
well, we're not actually
doing anything bad with this.

40
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.900
我们只是把它交给别人
We're just handing it off to someone else.

41
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.780
所以，灰色帽子被称为一个道德模棱两可的人。
So gray hat is known as someone
who's morally ambiguous.

42
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.170
好的安全研究人员试图保护你和
The good security researchers, the people
that are trying to protect you and

43
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.510
使您的软件保持最新，并尝试查找漏洞和
keep your software up-to-date and
are trying to find vulnerabilities and

44
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.431
然后告诉公司他们被称为白帽子黑客，
then tell the companies about them
are known as white hat hackers,

45
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:31.603
而且是保安人员
and are security people.

46
00:02:31.603 --> 00:02:35.495
而那些坏的，滑稽的，都被称为黑帽。
And the bad ones, the nefarious ones,
are known as black hats.

47
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:39.194
然后这里是黑客和坏人的最低级别
And then there's the lowest here of
hackers and bad security people,

48
00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:41.099
被称为剧本基子
which are known as script kiddies.

49
00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.950
那些只是从互联网下载东西的人
Those are people that just download
things from the Internet and

50
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.709
然后针对整个 IP 范围运行它以尝试中断，是吗 ?
then run it against entire IP
ranges trying to break in, yes?

51
00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.382
>> 演讲者 3: 最着名的零天事物之一是 Stuxnet，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: One of the most
famous zero day things was Stuxnet,

52
00:02:51.382 --> 00:02:55.947
我们的政府或者袭击伊朗的人
where our government or
whoever attacked the Iran

53
00:02:55.947 --> 00:03:01.599
放射性程序什么的核计划
radioactive program or
whatever, nuclear program.

54
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.674
然后他们用了四天零的时间
And then they used four zero day things

55
00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:10.954
把这蠕虫传播到
as a worm to spread this worm into

56
00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:15.563
这设施简直太疯狂了
the facility, it's just crazy.

57
00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:19.424
>> Jem Young: Stuxnet 是迷人的。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Stuxnet is fascinating.

58
00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:23.937
我们说的是安全每个政府都有自己的
We're talking about security, every
government in the world has their own

59
00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:27.590
安全团队和黑客团队以及零日团队
security teams and
hacking teams and zero day teams.

60
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.300
他们说的不多但是
They won't talk much about it, but

61
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.090
他们都有他们因为这场网络战已经开始了
they all have them because it's
this cyber war that's going on.

62
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.853
但我不会说战争的但这不是官方的
But I won't say war,
cuz it's not official, but

63
00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:37.378
每个人都在试图闯进所有人
pretty much everybody's trying to
break into everybody all the time.

64
00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:40.564
如果您查看您的认证日志，您将看到有人尝试在您的
If you look at your auth log you see that
there's people trying to break in your

65
00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:41.360
就在服务器上
server right now.

66
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.460
Stuxnet 是一个非常有趣的例子。
Stuxnet is a really interesting example.

67
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.770
如果他们能进入你的服务器，他们能做些什么呢 ?
And it goes back to, what can someone
do if they gain access to your server?

68
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.991
所以 Stuxnet 做的是把一堆零日链在一起
So what Stuxnet did was they
chained a bunch of zero day, so

69
00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:54.587
都是未经修补的未知的虫子
that is unpatched, unknown bugs.

70
00:03:54.587 --> 00:03:57.751
它们通常以堆溢出或类似的方式开始。
And they usually start with some sort of
a stack overflow or something like that,

71
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.150
一些无害的东西
something innocuous.

72
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.685
但如果你能让电脑栈溢出的话，你就可以把它丢出一个错误，
But if you can make a computer stack
overflow, you can make it throw an error,

73
00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:02.818
这个错误你可以控制
and that error, you can control.

74
00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:05.472
一旦你开始把这些人联系起来
And then once you start
chaining those together,

75
00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:07.689
你可以开始做点什么
you can actually start doing something.

76
00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.403
所以即使是最轻微的脆弱性，如果有人知道，
So even the most minor vulnerability can
turn into something major if someone knows

77
00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:12.420
他们在做什么
what they're doing.

78
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.731
Stuxnet 做的是把软件植入
And what Stuxnet did was
they planted software into,

79
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.346
我想说它是 USB 驱动器，就是这样开始的。
I wanna say it was the USB drives,
that's how it started.

80
00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:23.023
因为这是提炼浓缩铀或钚的核设施，
Because this was a nuclear facility
that refined uranium, or plutonium,

81
00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:24.024
可能是铀
probably uranium.

82
00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:25.531
他们就像是
And they're like, okay,

83
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.018
我们知道我们正在处理非常危险的事情
we know we're dealing with things
that are really dangerous.

84
00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.600
我们根本不可能连接到互联网。
We're not gonna connect
to the Internet at all.

85
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.490
Stuxnet 做了什么，他们把它连在了一个人的 USB 驱动器上。
So what Stuxnet did was they
hooked up to someone's USB drive.

86
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.656
所以我不知道，一个秘书或一个人，每当他们侵入他们的电脑时。
So I don't know, a secretary or someone,
so whenever they hacked their computer.

87
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:45.182
所以当他们插进 USB 驱动器的时候，他们就把软件扔进了那个。
So whenever they plugged in the USB drive,
they dumped the software into that.

88
00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:48.293
所以当那个人去工作的时候，他们插上了那个 U 盘，
So when that person went to work and
they plugged in that USB to,

89
00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:52.644
我不知道，看电影什么的，核设施里的人怎么做，
I don't know, watch movies or something,
whatever people at nuclear facilities do,

90
00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:54.264
在他们的服务器上
that now got on to their server.

91
00:04:54.264 --> 00:04:58.800
所以即使那台电脑还没有连接到互联网上
So even though that computer wasn't
connected at all to the Internet, they now

92
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.547
成功地渗透到整个网络，而这就是下一个级别的黑客攻击。
managed to infiltrate the entire network,
which honestly is next level hacking.

93
00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:07.990
如果你可以黑进某人的服务器而不与它连接
If you can hack someone's server
without actually being connected to it,

94
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.576
就好像只有政府能做到或者真的
that's like only something governments
can achieve, or really, really,

95
00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:14.425
真正的大公司
really big funded companies.

96
00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:16.264
但他们做的真的很微妙。
But what they did was really subtle.

97
00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:20.927
他们只是关闭了提炼浓缩铀的东西。
They just turned off the controls for
the things that refined uranium.

98
00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:22.269
所以他们让他们失控了
So they just made them
spin out of control.

99
00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:25.807
他们摧毁了数百万美元的机器和机器
And they literally destroyed millions and
millions of dollars in machinery and

100
00:05:25.807 --> 00:05:26.769
让他们重新回到过去
set them back years.

101
00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:31.269
因为他们的服务器不安全，安全协议很糟糕。
All because their servers weren't secure
and their security protocols were bad.

102
00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:34.040
所以，我再一次说，这是为了吓唬你，因为你应该害怕。
So again, I say this to scare you
because you should be scared.

103
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.838
你不知道安全性差的意外后果。
You don't know the unintended
consequences of having bad security.

104
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.144
另一个常见的安全因子是两个因子认证。
Another common security factor
is two factor authentication.

105
00:05:42.144 --> 00:05:44.867
这就意味着你会用 SSH 的方式
That just means instead of just SSHing,
you would SSH and

106
00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:47.774
他们就会向你的手机发送某种推送通知
then they send some sort of push
notification to your phone.

107
00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:51.891
你会把你的电话或 UB 的钥匙插在你的手机里然后你说
A device you'd have on you or a UB key you
plug into your phone, and then you say,

108
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:52.826
对我就是这个
yes, this is me.

109
00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:57.612
这是另一个我们都很熟悉的认证层。
It's just another layer of authentication
that we're all pretty familiar with.

110
00:05:57.612 --> 00:06:00.680
但这并不总是可行的，因为周围有各种方法。
But that doesn't always work too
because there are ways around that.

111
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.540
例如， Twitter 的 CEO Jack Dorsey 被黑客侵入
For instance, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter,
got hacked because Twitter

112
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.300
有这个奇怪的变通方法你可以通过短信发送推文
has this weird workaround where you can
still send tweets via text message.

113
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.089
他们做的都是叫电话电报电话他们说
So all they did was they called
up AT&amp;T and they said, or

114
00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.480
不管他的电话公司是什么，他们说，嘿，我有个新电话，我是杰克 - 多尔西。
whatever his phone company was, they said,
hey, I got a new phone, I'm Jack Dorsey.

115
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.718
他们就像你确定吗
And they're like, are you sure?

116
00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:21.103
他们就像是
They're like, yeah.

117
00:06:21.103 --> 00:06:23.189
他们就像好吧听起来不错
They're like, okay, sounds good to me.

118
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.591
所以他的密码很可能是他的两个因子认证
And so his probably long password,
his two factor authentication was rendered

119
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.362
一文不值因为只有一种方法
worthless because there's
just a way around it.

120
00:06:30.362 --> 00:06:34.119
这就是为什么当我们想到安全的时候
That's why when we think about security
we're talking about creating an entire

121
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.564
我们所做的一切
wall around everything we do.

122
00:06:35.564 --> 00:06:38.269
然后我们说的每一步你确定吗
And then every step of the way we say,
are you sure?

123
00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.917
你确定吗 而且
Are you sure?
And

124
00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:43.531
当我们有 sudo 的东西时，它看起来很麻烦，但这是因为它。
it seems really onerous whenever we have
the sudo things, but it's because of that.

125
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:46.062
您总是希望在方式的每个步骤上都有安全性。
You always want security
on every step of the way.

126
00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:50.441
可能大多数公司使用的另一个安全功能是 VPN，
Another security feature that
probably most companies use is a VPN,

127
00:06:50.441 --> 00:06:52.262
虚拟专用网。
a virtual private network.

128
00:06:52.262 --> 00:06:55.144
那就是网络和网络之间的墙
That's essentially a wall
between the Internet and

129
00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:57.665
我们之前讨论过的内联网
the Intranet, which we discussed earlier.

130
00:06:57.665 --> 00:06:59.439
内部网是私人互联网。
Intranet is private Internet.

131
00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.726
这就意味着所有穿过墙的东西都是未支配的。
And it just means everything
through the wall is unencumbered.

132
00:07:02.726 --> 00:07:04.855
你可以发展，你可以推动，你可以拉，
You can develop,
you can push, you can pull,

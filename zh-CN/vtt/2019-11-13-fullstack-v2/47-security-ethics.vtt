00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.762
>> Jem Young: 有一个，哪个队 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: There is a,
which team is it?

2
00:00:01.762 --> 00:00:05.214
我忘了他们在谷歌的电话
I forget what they're called at Google.

3
00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:09.675
如果你问我我的梦想工作是什么，如果我是安全的，那就是谷歌 X 团队或者
If you ask me what my dream job is, if I
was in security, it's the Google X Team or

4
00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.380
就像这样
something like that.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.919
他们的工作只是黑进了
And their job is only to hack or

6
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.190
尝试在软件中找到零天，然后让制造商知道。
try to find zero days in software,
then they let the manufacturer know.

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.410
他们就像白帽黑客一样
And they do that as
being white hat hackers.

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.074
这就像在世界上做得很好，就是，
And it's kind of like doing
good in the world, which is,

9
00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:24.972
这工作真的很酷
it's really cool that that job exists.

10
00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:29.515
但其中一个问题是关于安全问题
But one of the issues is about,
when it comes to security,

11
00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:33.316
如果我是一名安全研究员我说
is if I'm a security researcher and
I say, hey,

12
00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:39.000
前端主控在软件中有一个安全漏洞。
Frontend Masters,
you have a security hole in your software.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.719
我告诉你我有什么责任
And I tell you about that,
what responsibility do I have?

14
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:42.990
库兹本质上我找到了一个零日
Cuz essentially, I found a zero day.

15
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.789
我告诉你你什么都没做
And I tell you and
you don't do anything about that.

16
00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.390
我该怎么办
What do I do?

17
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.765
我该怎么办
What should I do?

18
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.024
我不认为我们今天要谈道德
I didn't think we were gonna
talk about ethics today.

19
00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:52.880
但让我们谈谈道德问题。
But let's talk a little bit about ethics.

20
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.920
那么，公司的责任是什么 ?
So, what is the responsibility
of companies?

21
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.030
如果我说嘿，我在你的银行软件里发现了一个漏洞或者类似的东西。
If I say hey, I found a bug in your
bank software or something like that.

22
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.613
你觉得呢
What do you think?

23
00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:04.421
这是个讨论你知道吗
Cuz this is a discussion, you know?

24
00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:11.251
>> 演讲者 2: 补丁，他们应该修补缺陷。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Patch it,
they should patch the defect.

25
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.978
> > Jem Young: 但如果他们不呢 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But what if they don't?

26
00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:16.393
>> 扬声器 3: 设置时间和时间
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A set amount of time and

27
00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:20.650
然后你就会在推特上给他们施压
then you kind of put them on blast
on Twitter something to pressure.

28
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.182
> > Jem Young: 是的，现在我们进入了一个真正的灰色地带
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, and now we get
into a really ethically gray area, and

29
00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:30.079
这就是为什么安全的原因我花了那么多时间在它上它真的很有趣
that's why security is, I spend so much
time on it cuz it's really interesting.

30
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.276
如果我说 Fronsend Masters 的 CEO 马克 - 格拉班斯基
Yeah, if I say, Marc Grabanski,
CEO of Frontend Masters,

31
00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:36.493
我给你发邮件了 frontendmasters.com上有个漏洞
I emailed you that there's
a bug on frontendmasters.com.

32
00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:40.009
我 30 天前给你发邮件你还没修好
And I emailed you 30 days ago and
you didn't fix it yet.

33
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.109
这就意味着如果我找到它别人就能找到它
And that means if I found it,
someone else can find it and

34
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.719
他们现在可以利用它我想你有责任解决这个问题
they can be exploiting it now and I think
it's your responsibility to fix that.

35
00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.939
如果他们不这样的话我可以公开说
And if they don't,
at that point I can say publicly,

36
00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.140
frontendmasters.com 有个漏洞我可以公开羞辱他们
hey, there's a bug on frontendmasters.com
and I can shame them publicly.

37
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.265
这在道德上是令人怀疑的
Which is ethically dubious,

38
00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.950
在那个时候我把这个漏洞都给大家公布了
cuz at that point I just released
this vulnerability to everybody.

39
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.319
如果他们还没有解决这个问题，现在全世界都知道这个洞已经存在了。
And if they still don't fix it, now the
entire world knows that this hole exists.

40
00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.408
这就是为什么安全研究人员是一个真正的人，它是一个非常棘手的领域。
And that's why security researcher is
a really, it's a really tricky area.

41
00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:10.211
因为在什么意义上如果它是一个非常复杂的漏洞
Because at what point, like what
if it's a really complicated bug,

42
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:13.439
如果他们花了 30 天时间才能修好它呢
what if it takes them more
than 30 days to fix it?

43
00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.560
我还是会释放它的
And I still release it anyways.

44
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.860
这对他们不公平，但也应该修复这个洞。
That's not fair to them, but
they should also fix the hole, too.

45
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.420
好的杰夫
Yes, Jeff.

46
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.719
>> 杰夫: 我想说的是，根据脆弱程度的复杂程度
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Well, I was gonna say, depending
on the complexity of the vulnerability and

47
00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.439
有多少人可能受到影响
how many people are potentially affected.

48
00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.840
据我所知有一套不同的标准
As I understand it,
there's a different set of standards for

49
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.403
您期望一家公司做出响应的紧急情况。
how urgently you expect
a company to respond.

50
00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:40.498
还有就是你也可以在一段时间后宣布，
And the other thing is, you can also
announce after a certain amount of time,

51
00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:44.545
无论是一个月还是六个月，你可以说，嘿，我们发现了一个漏洞。
whether it's a month or six months,
you can say, hey, we've found a bug.

52
00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:47.528
你不必说它是什么地方，怎么利用它。
You don't have to say where it is or
how to exploit it.

53
00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.229
6 个月或一年后就像这样
Versus six months or a year later,
it's like, by the way,

54
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.949
这就是我们发现漏洞的地方
this is where we found the bug.

55
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:58.409
还有一些 GitHub 存储库
And here's some available GitHub repos, so

56
00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.669
任何孩子的剧本都能让它妥协
that any script kiddy could compromise it,
to show just how easy it is.

57
00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.639
我的意思是，有一个渐进的反应，而不是仅仅是什么都没有。
I mean, there's a graduated response
rather than just all or nothing.

58
00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.659
>> Jem Young: 是的，但即使在那里
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, but
even there it gets so

59
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.939
因为如果我说你的登录协议有漏洞的话
ethically dubious because what if I say
there's a bug with your login protocol.

60
00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.520
我刚刚宣布，在世界上，他们还没有在 30 天， 90 天内解决这个问题。
And I just announce that to the world, cuz
they haven't fixed it in 30 days, 90 days.

61
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.210
足够让足够多的人开始酝酿
That's enough that enough people
are gonna start hammering on that and

62
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.270
他们可能也会发现这种脆弱性
they're probably gonna find
that vulnerability too.

63
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.349
所以即使你想做正确的事
So even then, even if you're
trying to do the right thing,

64
00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.370
你还是会惹麻烦的
you can still get in trouble.

65
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.069
这个问题没有正确的答案。
There's no right answer to this.

66
00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.293
谷歌的团队回应是他们向公司提供了 90 天的时间。
Google's team response is they
give 90 days to the company.

67
00:03:37.293 --> 00:03:40.161
所以他们会告诉你如果你不在 90 天内解决
So they'll tell you about it and
if you don't fix it in 90 days,

68
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:42.050
他们会把它释放出来
they'll release that out into the world.

69
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.819
这就像是一种命名和羞辱的类型。
And it's kind of like a naming and
shaming type thing.

70
00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.930
如果公司不作出回应
Which again,
if the company doesn't respond,

71
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.460
你刚刚把这个漏洞释放到世界上任何人都能利用
you've just released this bug out into the
world that anybody can take advantage of.

72
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.460
尤其是当你把这几天都链在一起
And especially when you start
chaining these zero days together,

73
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.259
你可以炸掉核反应堆之类的
you can blow up nuclear reactors,
things like that.

74
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.870
嗯。
Yes.

75
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.477
>演讲者 5: 最可怕的是我的医疗设备。
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The scariest one for
me is the medical device ones.

76
00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:07.451
因为在 DEFCON 他们会做一件事
Because at DEFCON they'll do a thing,
a presentation,

77
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:13.686
你是怎么让这个起搏器杀了人的对吧
here's how you make this
pacemaker kill someone, right?

78
00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.730
一些医疗设备公司不重视安全。
And some of the medical device companies
don't take security seriously.

79
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.600
所以我不知道这把我吓坏了
So I don't know,
that freaks me out anyways.

80
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.026
>> Jem Young: 它应该，你都应该被安全所吓到。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It should,
you should all be freaked out by security.

81
00:04:26.026 --> 00:04:27.413
当有小食的时候
And when there's hacks and

82
00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:31.519
我们都应该集体追究这些公司的责任。
breaches, we should all collectively
hold these companies more accountable.

83
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:36.052
对不起，这完全是正切的，但因为我在乎这些事情。
Sorry, this is totally tangent, but
because I care about these sort of things.

84
00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:39.620
Equifax ，他们有您的社会安全号码，所有信用记录，
Equifax, they have your Social Security
number, all of your credit history,

85
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.800
基本上我可以知道你是怎么花钱的
which essentially I can figure out who
you are by just how you spend your money.

86
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.790
他们被侵入了他们的后果对这些数据都是微不足道的
They got hacked and their consequences
were so minimal for this data that nobody

87
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.930
让他们收下，没有人让他们货币化，什么也没发生。
asked them to collect and nobody asked
them to monetize, and nothing happened.

88
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.250
所以说实话我觉得我们作为私人部门的工程师
So honestly, I think it's up to us as
engineers in the private sector to take

89
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.560
这些事情更严肃些，让公司承担责任。
these things more seriously and
hold companies accountable.

90
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.959
所以如果你看到你的公司有不良的安全惯例
So if you see your company
has bad security practice,

91
00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.220
你应该说点什么
you should say something.

92
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.886
看什么说点什么吧
See something, say something.

93
00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:08.410
[ LAUGH] 不管怎样，这是一个安全的切线。
[LAUGH] Anyways,
that was a tangent on security.

94
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.490
但到目前为止我们学到的东西就是让你的软件保持最新状态。
But what we've learned so
far is keep your software up to date.

95
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.290
这是你能做的最简单的事情之一
That's one of the easiest
things you can do,

96
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.129
在无人值守的升级过程中，它会为您提供服务。
with the unattended upgrades,
it does it for you.

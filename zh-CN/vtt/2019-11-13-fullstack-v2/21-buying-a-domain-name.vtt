00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:06.461
>> Jem Young: 好的，我们有服务器，我们能用服务器做什么 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, we've got our
server, and what can we do with a server?

2
00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:10.643
>> Jem Young: 这是一个窍门问题，我们可以为所欲为。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's a trick question,
we can do whatever we want.

3
00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:14.505
这是我们的计算机，我们可以让它响应我们想要的请求。
This is our computer, we can make it
respond to requests that we want.

4
00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:17.853
我们可以让它响应 ping ，我们可以使它不响应 ping。
We can make it respond to pings,
we can make it not respond to pings.

5
00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:20.699
在接下来的几个小时里
Over the next couple hours more instance,

6
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.870
明天我们会做些更先进的事情
tomorrow we'll do some
more advanced things.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.015
但今天我们要建立一个服务器
But for today,
we're gonna set up a server,

8
00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:29.460
我们会切换用户将使用户具有许可权
we're gonna switch user we're gonna
make that user have permissions to

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.072
做我们想在指引内做的事情
do everything that we wanted
to do within guidelines.

10
00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:37.406
但就像我说的我们现在正在路上
But like I said, we're in route now
you can tell by the hash sign and

11
00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:42.567
我想说的是我想说我是谁
the same thing I can clear it out,
so I want to I wanna say who am I?

12
00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:47.000
>> Jem Young: 这是一个真实的问题，我每天在镜子里问自己
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's a real question I asked
myself any day when I look in the mirror I

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.932
说我是谁呢
say, who am I, really?

14
00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:51.665
但我是根我们不想成为根
But I'm root and we don't wanna be root,

15
00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:57.009
我们想做别人我想做吉姆你想做你
we wanna be someone else,
I wanna be Jim, you wanna be you.

16
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.414
你想做的不是根
You wanna be something
other than you root,

17
00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:05.290
其实你几乎从来不想做根因为它是为了
in fact you almost never wanna do
things as root because it's to

18
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.691
当有人说你的黑客电脑酷的时候
the fact that when someone says
your hackers computer cool person.

19
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.376
没有人来找我就像我有根
No people come up to me
like I've got root and

20
00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:16.652
这意味着他们可以完全访问您的服务器。
that means that they have
full access to your server.

21
00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:19.742
事实上，它自己的破碎和接触只是我的常规。
In fact, its own broken and
had access is just regular me.

22
00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:23.296
也许他们能做些什么能让他们惹上麻烦
There's probably they could do some
stuff they can cause some trouble but

23
00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:23.935
没那么多
not as much.

24
00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.518
但如果他们有根，可以做很多很多坏事。
But if they have root,
they can do lots and lots of bad things.

25
00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:30.817
但在我们这样做之前我想买个域名
But before we do that,
I wanna buy a domain, all right, and

26
00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:34.097
你想让它完全是任择性的
the domain you want it's totally optional.

27
00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:37.715
你不需要买个域，你可能要一个 czz ，我们要成立一个
You don't have to buy a domain, and you
probably want one cuz we're gonna set up

28
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.423
一个子域我们会做很多其他的事情
a subdomain we're gonna do lots
of other things like that.

29
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:44.627
但是你不需要，你什么都可以用 IP 地址，但是
But you don't actually need to, you can
use an IP address for everything, but

30
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:48.384
我想买个域因为这是最后一个真正的一步
I wanted to buy a domain because it's
the final step in setting up a real

31
00:01:48.384 --> 00:01:50.831
应用程序，为公司提供真实的 Web 站点。
application, a real website for a company.

32
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:54.557
我使用 namecheap.com 你可以用你想要的东西
I use namecheap.com,
you can use anything you want,

33
00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:59.266
我们不会对实际的领域供应商做太多的工作
we're not gonna do too much with
the actual domain provider itself.

34
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.885
但是，我使用 Namecheap ，因为托管我的所有域。
But I use Namecheap because that
where all my domains are hosted.

35
00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:08.896
我知道他们的布局，他们的 UI 有点过时了，在我看来，对不起， Namecheap。
That's I know their layout, their UI is a
bit dated, in my opinion, sorry Namecheap.

36
00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:12.122
但是买域你可以用谷歌，你可以用 " 去爸爸" ，
But buy domain you can use Google,
you can use Go Daddy,

37
00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:13.919
你可以用任何你想要的东西
you can use whatever you want.

38
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.335
购买便宜的东西，因为它是您的测试域，或者
Buy something cheap because
it is your test domain, or

39
00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.814
买个真正的域名你正在建立一个真正的服务器它是你的全部
buy a real domain cuz you're setting up
a real server, it's wholey up to you.

40
00:02:19.814 --> 00:02:23.057
我要买我能想到的最有趣的域名
I'm gonna buy the funniest domain
name I could think of, and

41
00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:24.590
看看他能不能击败我
we'll see if he can beat me.

42
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.298
所以我要用 Namecheap 没有引荐链接
So I'm gonna use Namecheap,
there's no referral link or

43
00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:30.185
任何类似的内容，都可以使用 Google 或您需要的任何主机。
anything like that, you can use Google or
any hosts you want.

44
00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:35.075
我推荐的是便宜的，很有趣的，但是你做了，所以
I recommend .party cuz it's a cheap
domain and it's funny but you do you, so

45
00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:39.817
如果你买了一个，很多人会坐在他们多年前买的
if you bought a, lot of people will sit
on domains they bought a years ago for

46
00:02:39.817 --> 00:02:42.920
一些他们从来没有得到过的项目
some side project that
they never got around to.

47
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.819
这不是我的工作让你觉得内疚你是个忙碌的人
And it's not my job to make you feel
guilty about that, you're a busy person,

48
00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.199
你没时间去探索这些领域
you don't have time to
explore these domains.

49
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.699
但是你可能有个坐在身边的人感觉自己
But, just so you might have had one
sitting around, feel like myself,

50
00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.628
我有 20 个领域只是坐在那里
I have like 20 domains that
were just sitting there.

51
00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:57.829
我可以告诉你上一次我带了 jem.party
Well, I can tell you,
last class I brought jem.party,

52
00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.830
这很有趣但那是最后一个课我想把它混在一起
which is pretty funny but that was
the last class, I wanna mix it up.

53
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.138
所以我买了 jem 是最好的，jemisththe.最优的，是的，那是一个真实的领域。
So I bought jem is the best,
jemisthe.best, yes, that's a real domain.

54
00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:12.941
我想买个小怪物但它就像 2 万美金的怪物
I tried to buy party.monster, but
it's like $20,000 party.monster.

55
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.983
我希望你能挑选出一些令人难忘的东西
Anyways, hopefully you pick something
memorable and easy to type and

56
00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:21.314
只要你再给我打个字就好了，如果不行，就好了。
nothing too long cuz you will be typing
it quite a bit, if not, it's okay.

57
00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:24.848
您现在就可以使用 IP 地址，就像我们之前说的，域名是
You can just use the IP address for
now like we said earlier, domain name is

58
00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:28.399
只是为了帮你记住因为你没有给你的 IP 地址
just to help you remember that because
you're not given your IP address.

59
00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:33.155
但是我们之前谈到域如何通过名称服务器获取结果，但是
But earlier we talked about how domains
get results via the name servers, but

60
00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:38.514
因为名称服务器保存记录，它们被称为 DNS 记录。
the results because the name servers keep
records, and they're called DNS records.

61
00:03:38.514 --> 00:03:43.659
还有不同类型的 DNS 记录取决于您想做什么。
And there's different types of DNS
records depending on what you wanna do.

62
00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.454
大多数记录称为 A 记录，它们将名称映射到 IP 地址。
Most records are called A records,
and they map a name to an IP address.

63
00:03:49.454 --> 00:03:53.878
例如， jemoung.com 映射到23.不管点，工作，看，我不
For instance, jemoung.com maps to
23.whatever dot, that works, see, I don't

64
00:03:53.878 --> 00:03:58.252
记得我自己的 IP 地址，我已经有了七年了，所以我不记得了。
remember my own IP address, I've had it
for like seven years, so I don't remember.

65
00:03:58.252 --> 00:04:04.431
您想知道的其他记录是 CNAME，并且仅映射 A 或
The other record you wanna know about is
the CNAME, and that just maps an A or

66
00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:09.448
与 IP 地址不同名称的规范名称。
an a canonical name to a different
name versus an IP address.

67
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:13.799
例如， jemyoug.com 是 A 记录，因此
For example, jemyoug.com is a A record, so

68
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.841
将 jemyoug.com 映射至 23.23.185.61
it maps jemyoug.com to 23.23.185.61

69
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:24.125
与 blog.jemyoug.com 是 CNAME 记录。
versus blog.jemyoug.com,
that is a CNAME record.

70
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.964
因为它将子域映射到 IP 地址，
Because it maps the sub
domain to an IP address,

71
00:04:26.964 --> 00:04:31.310
它将它映射到 jemyoug.com 然后将它映射到 23.23。
it actually maps it to jemyoug.com and
then that maps it to 23.23.

72
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.783
我们这样做的方式
And the way we can do this,

73
00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:37.019
我们可以检查给定域是否有使用 dig 命令的记录。
we can check on the records that a given
domain has is we use the dig command.

74
00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:40.954
所以我们去尝试一下，你可以在你的服务器上使用它。
So let's go and try that out,
you can use it on your server or not.

75
00:04:40.954 --> 00:04:44.492
我要退出我的服务器我不喜欢用根做事情
I'm gonna exit my server cuz I
don't like doing things with root,

76
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.634
你永远不知道
you just never know.

77
00:04:45.634 --> 00:04:51.379
所以我要退出然后继续挖我说在 jemyoung.com上
So I'm gonna exit and run dig, and
I'll say run dig on jemyoung.com,

78
00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.560
我们会知道我们有什么记录
we'll see what kinda records we have.

79
00:04:57.302 --> 00:04:58.901
>> Jem Young: 有什么意思吗 ?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Anything interesting?

80
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.887
是啊现在我们只有一个我们有个 A 记录
Yeah, so right now we just have one,
we have an A record,

81
00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:05.017
我们之前说过的就是这个 IP 地址
which we talked about earlier and
that's this IP address.

82
00:05:05.017 --> 00:05:07.209
您可以在大多数域上运行挖掘
And you can run dig on most domains and

83
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:11.312
就能挖掘出它拥有记录的记录
it's just gonna dig up what sort of
records it has who holds records,

84
00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:15.225
就像拥有这个电话簿的人
essentially like who owns this
phone book that maps this to this.

85
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:18.843
但如果我说挖的话我会说 blog.jemyoung.com
But if I say dig,
I'll say blog.jemyoung.com,

86
00:05:18.843 --> 00:05:23.908
它是一个子域， >> Jem Young: 它给我 2个。
which is a sub domain,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It gives me a 2.

87
00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:27.346
它给我一个 CNAME ，它重定向 jemyoung.com
It gives me a CNAME,
which redirects jemyoung.com, and

88
00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:30.651
然后它会给我一个映射到实际 IP的记录。
then it gives me the A record
which maps to the actual IP.

89
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:33.776
所以我们看到 CNAME，只是映射到另一个域，
So we see the CNAME,
just maps to a different domain, and

90
00:05:33.776 --> 00:05:36.069
然后在内部映射到 A 记录。
then internally that maps to an A record.

91
00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.321
我知道你是这样我为什么要在乎
I know you're like, why should I care?

92
00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:42.117
你在乎的是我们马上要把它设置好
Well you care because we're
about to set it up right now,

93
00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:46.271
我想让你知道你在做什么我也不是在自说自话
and I want you to know what you're doing,
and I'm not just self telling you things.

94
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:50.002
但那是挖出来的所以你可以说
But again that was dig,
so you can say man dig,

95
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:53.850
它有实用，很直接。
it has the utility,
pretty straightforward.

96
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.117
想知道谁有我们网站的信息就好了
Its good if you wanna know who has
information about our website things

97
00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:57.680
就像这样
like that.

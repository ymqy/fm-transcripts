>> Jem Young: 另一个是， Nginx 的另一个是添加子域。
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The other one is, another
thing with Nginx is adding a subdomain.

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.890
昨天我们为服务器创建了一个服务器块
Yesterday we created a server block for
our servers, and

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.519
这就是所谓的虚拟主机。
that's what's known as a virtual host.

4
00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.419
所以我可以创造十个不同的领域
So I could create ten
different domains and

5
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.730
在一个 Nginx 配置上十个不同的服务器。
ten different servers on
one Nginx configuration.

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.035
根据我试图击中的 URL
And depending on the url
that I'm trying to hit,

7
00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.969
内克斯会把我重定向到正确的地方
Nginx will redirect me to the right place.

8
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:29.879
因此，在这种情况下，我创建了一个名为test.j发射台的子域。
So in this case I created a subdomain
called test.jemisthe.best.

9
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:34.515
还有边便条，我后悔做 jem 是最好的，因为它没滚
And a side note, I regret doing jem is
the best because it just doesn't roll off

10
00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.310
像 jem.party的舌头
the tongue like jem.party.

11
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.640
也许在 V3 我会做 jem.party
Maybe in V3 I'll do jem.party.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.689
或者杰姆知道怎么派对我不知道
Or Jem knows how to party, I don't know.

13
00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.609
但 Nginx 的伟大是我们可以像我们想要的那么多的领域。
But what's great about Nginx is we
can have as many domains as we want.

14
00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.159
我们可以拥有尽可能多的服务器
And we can have as many
servers as we want,

15
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.259
因为从你的心理模型来看，这是它自己的一个服务器。
because in terms of your mental model,
this is a server on its own.

16
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.829
在编程方面，这是一个单独的服务器。
In terms of programming,
this is a server on its own.

17
00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.409
在花钱的情况下，只有一台服务器。
In terms of paying for money,
you only have one server.

18
00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.119
太棒了 这里有无限的服务器可用。
So that's great.
You have infinite servers here available.

19
00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.069
稍后，我们将创建一个类似的子域。
Later in the course, we're going to
create a subdomain just like this.

20
00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.670
我们要把它管到我们的服务器上。
And we're going to pipe it to our server.

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.694
然后我们就会创建一个应用程序
And then we're going to create
an application that just lives on that

22
00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:14.269
而不是我们的主域
subdomain rather than our main domain.

23
00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:18.319
但现在，这就是你的一个子领域，而不是太艰难。
But for now, this is how you had
a subdomain in, not too hard.

24
00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.379
有什么问题吗
Any questions on this?

25
00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.819
因为这很重要
Because this is kind of important.

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.530
但我们可以稍后再参考。
But we can reference back later.

27
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.620
如果你想知道这双冒号是什么
And if you're wondering
what these double colon and

28
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.020
支架也不是笑脸
brackets, it's not really a smiley face.

29
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.509
我不知道我在想如果有一个能匹配的情绪
I don't know, It's, I'm trying to think
if there's an emoji that matches this,

30
00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.870
有两个戴着帽子和胡子的人
two people with a hat and a beard.

31
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.629
我不知道我不知道
I don't know.

32
00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.140
这只是 IPv6 的注音
That's just IPv6 notation.

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.569
还记得昨天我们学到了因为我们的 IP 地址用完了
Remember yesterday we learned that
because we ran out of IP addresses,

34
00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.750
我们必须创建 IPv6 ，这将为我们提供 304 个不消零的数字，这就是一堆零。
we had to create IPv6, which would give us
304 undecillion, which is a lot of zeros.

35
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.590
我记得这个事实
And the fact that I remembered that, but

36
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.099
我不记得要怎么做才知道我不是完美的
I can't remember how to properly do
a find just shows you I'm not perfect.

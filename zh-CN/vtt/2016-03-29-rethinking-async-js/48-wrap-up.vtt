&gt；&gt；Kyle：所以就像那个快速回顾一样，这真的是关于加号的。
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So just as that quick review, this is really all about plus.

3
00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:11.240
这是AND，不是OR。
This is an and, not an or.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.140
我们需要回拨和重击。
We want callbacks and thunks.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.890
我们需要承诺和发电机，以及可观测的，和CSP。
We want promises and generators, and observables, and CSP.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.199
我们希望所有这些工具都能为我们所用，
We want all these tools available to us,

7
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.769
因为这会让我们成为更好的开发者。
cuz that's gonna make us better developers.

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.480
好吗？
Okay?

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.309
作为提醒，这是我的联系信息。
As a reminder this is my contact information.

10
00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.969
我强烈鼓励和
I strongly encourage and

11
00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.140
挑战你不要让这是你最后一次复习材料。
challenge you to not let this be the last time you go over the material.

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.435
几周后回到这些练习中，从头开始尝试。
Go back to these exercises in a couple of weeks and try them from scratch.

13
00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.835
回去复习幻灯片，复习你的笔记。
Go back over the slides, over your notes.

14
00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.895
尝试这些事情，并尝试将它们融入你正在做的工作中。
Try these things and try to work them into the work that you're doing.

15
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:44.557
即使你认为你的老板是这样的，
Even if you think you have a boss who is like,

16
00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:47.454
他永远不会在乎我在做这种事，这并不意味着
he'll never care that I'm doing this kinda stuff, that doesn't mean that

17
00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:51.575
你不能把你在工作中做的事情当作学习更好的机会。
you can't use the stuff that you do at work as an opportunity to learn better.

18
00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:55.408
即使你试图把东西拿出来，即使代码永远不会被提交进去，
Even if you're trying and stuff out, and even if that code never gets committed in,

19
00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:58.549
更好的是你在上下文中尝试并从中学习。
and it's still better that you try it in context and learn from that.

20
00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.119
当你学到东西的时候，如果你学到了什么，我会鼓起你的勇气
And I'd courage you that when you learn something, if you've learned something

21
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.340
今天在这里，或者当你回去的时候，如果你觉得你学到了什么
here today, or if you feel like you learned something when you go back over

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.579
一些东西，去写两到三段关于它的博客帖子。
some stuff, go write a little two or three paragraph blog post about it.

23
00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.299
试着教别人。
Try to teach someone else.

24
00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.700
因为当你被迫去教别人的时候，你真的学得最好。
Because you really learn best, when you're forced to try to teach somebody else.

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.170
所以无论你的领域是什么
So whatever your realm is,

26
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.129
你不一定要在你的职称中有“教师”这个词才能成为一名教师。
you don't have to have the word teacher in your job title to be a teacher.

27
00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:23.900
你可以写一篇博客文章，你可以去开会讨论它，然后
You can write a blog post, you can go to a meet up and talk about it, and

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.129
做一个闪电般的演讲，写一本关于它的书。
give a lightning talk about it, write a book about it.

29
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:31.569
我的意思是，做你想做的事，但是在工作中给一个棕色的袋子午餐，说嘿，我只是
I mean, do whatever you wanna do, but give a brown bag lunch at work, say hey I just

30
00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.659
去了这个工作坊，让我给你看看我学到的一些东西，对吧？
went to this workshop, let me show you some of the stuff that I learned, right?

31
00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.750
这就是你如何巩固学习，
That is how you'll solidify the learning,

32
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.479
就是练习这些东西然后教别人。
is to practice those things then teach others.

33
00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.960
所以在经历这些事情的过程中，如果你有任何问题
So in that process of going through those things, if you ever have any questions you

34
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.397
今天感到不知所措，你知道你想绕回来，
feel overwhelmed by something today, and you know you wanna circle back,

35
00:01:47.397 --> 00:01:49.950
当你想回去的时候，你对此有一些疑问。
and you've got some questions about it, when you want to go back.

36
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.960
请随时联系，
Please feel free to reach out,

37
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.229
有几十种不同的方法可以联系到我。
there's dozens of different ways to get a hold of me.

38
00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:54.770
我喜欢做这个。
I love doing this.

39
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.289
这就是我，我全身心投入教学的事情，
This is what I, I'm all in on the teaching thing,

40
00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.709
试图帮助人们更好地理解JavaScript。
trying to help people understand JavaScript better.

41
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.390

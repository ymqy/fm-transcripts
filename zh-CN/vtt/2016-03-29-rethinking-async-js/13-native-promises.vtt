00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt；&gt；Kyle：什么是承诺？
&gt;&gt; Kyle: What is a promise?

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:07.860
有很多不同的方式，
There are a multitude of different ways,

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.380
承诺有几种不同的解释方式，我将选择两种或两种
several different ways that promises are explained and I will choose two or

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.750
这里通过比喻和例证的方式解释了其中的三个。
three of those explanations here by way of metaphor and illustration.

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.469
再说一次，因为对我来说更重要的是你理解这个概念
Again, because it's more important to me that you understand the concept

7
00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:24.670
先承诺后，再理解API。
behind promises first, before understanding the API.

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.910
这与大多数这类东西通常被教授的方式相反。
It's the reverse of the way most of this stuff is typically taught.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.100
但我想让你明白为什么承诺如此重要。
But I want you to understand why promises are so important.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.170
因为他们并不完美。
Because they're not perfect.

11
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.399
当你对这个承诺感到沮丧，或者是一些奇怪的事情时，
And when there is some frustration with the promise, or something that's weird,

12
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.090
或者有一些问题，那里有问题。
or there's some gotcha, there are gotchas there.

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.960
当你在路上遇到一些麻烦，你很沮丧
And when there's some gotcha down the road and you're frustrated and

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.289
你找到了你自己。
you find yourself.

15
00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.890
这里有个线索。
Here's a clue.

16
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.710
有一种东西叫做诺言地狱。
There's is such a thing as promises hell.

17
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.295
如果有回电卖出，就有卖出的承诺。
If there's a call back sell, there's a promise to sell.

18
00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.000
当你发现自己陷入承诺地狱时，你会诅咒他们。
When you find yourself stuck in promises hell in your cursing at them.

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.319
我不想让你转身说，好吧，我只是摆脱问题。
I don't want you to turn around and say, well I just get rid of problems.

20
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.460
需要理解为什么它们更重要
Need to understand why they're more important,

21
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.509
而不仅仅是他们的API的使用。
than just the usage of their API.

22
00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.530
如果我可以改变它，我会改变API的一些东西。
If I could change it, there are some things I would change about the API.

23
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.349
但我不会改变他们在那里的事实。
But I wouldn't change the fact that they're there.

24
00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:11.409
它们是我们所取得的最重要的进步之一
They are one of the most important advances that we've made in

25
00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.879
编码合理的异步编码模式。
codifying reasonable asynchronous coding patterns.

26
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:20.010
所以，首先让我给你一个关于承诺的场景。
So, first let me give you a scenario around promises.

27
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.969
这很愚蠢，在这里很早就在一起
It's silly, where it's early here together and

28
00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.969
我想确保我们都醒了
I want to make sure that we're all kind of awake.

29
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.650
我看到人们喝着咖啡，所以喝了更多的咖啡，
I see people sipping on coffee and so have more coffee,

30
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.329
因为你的大脑今天必须开动所有的气缸才能拿到东西。
cuz your brains are gonna have to fire on all cylinders to get stuff today.

31
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.640
但这里有个愚蠢的比喻要解释给你听。
But here's a silly metaphor to explain to you.

32
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.650
我走到我最喜欢的快餐店的柜台前，然后
I walk up to the counter at my favorite fast food restaurant, and

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.400
我点了一个芝士汉堡。
I order a cheeseburger.

34
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.450
所以我问这位女士，我想要一个芝士汉堡，她说，
So I asked the lady, I'd like a cheeseburger and she says,

35
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.049
一共是39美元。
that will be a $39.

36
00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.329
所以我把钱递给她，给她39美元。
And so I hand her the money, give her the $39.

37
00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.000
所以我已经通过订购和
So I have begun the transaction by ordering and

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.579
为某事付出一些钱。
giving some money for something.

39
00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.770
我期望这笔交易的回报是什么？
What am I expecting in return of this transaction?

40
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.769
我在等芝士汉堡。
I'm expecting a cheeseburger.

41
00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:03.069
但通常情况下，我不会马上拿到芝士汉堡。
But oftentimes, I'm not handed a cheeseburger immediately.

42
00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.250
我被给予了什么？
What instead am I given?

43
00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:10.090
一张收据，重要的是收据上有订单号，对吧？
A receipt, and importantly on that receipt it has an order number on it, right?

44
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.088
我的订单上写着，317号订单。
My order says, order number 317.

45
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.229
所以我拿着收据，看着我的订单号，然后
So I take that receipt, and I look at my order number, and

46
00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.620
这个订单号已经成为我未来芝士汉堡的一个占位符。
that order number has become a placeholder for my future cheeseburger.

47
00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.469
这是一张借条。
It is an IOU.

48
00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.171
这是对未来芝士汉堡的承诺。
It is a promise for a future cheeseburger.

49
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.365
他们欠我一个芝士汉堡因为我给了钱，
They owe me a cheeseburger because I have given the money,

50
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.659
我已经开始交易了。
I've started a transaction.

51
00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.770
现在，我还没有奶酪汉堡，我不能咬它，但是
Now, I don't have the cheeseburger yet, I can't bite into it, but

52
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.479
这并不意味着我不能开始思考
that doesn't mean I can't begin to think about and

53
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.990
思考和梦想我未来的芝士汉堡。
reason about and dream about my future cheeseburger.

54
00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.590
我可以开始思考它在我的嘴里可以开始流口水，我可以在和
I can begin to think about it in my mouth can begin to salivate and I can be in and

55
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.349
让芝士汉堡在我的脑海里翩翩起舞
have cheeseburgers dancing in my head about how

56
00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.920
令人惊讶的是这个芝士汉堡会是，我饿死了，我迫不及待地想吃了。
amazing this cheeseburger is gonna be, I'm famished, I can't wait to eat it.

57
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.349
我手里有东西可以让我开始
I have something in my hand that allows me to begin to

58
00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.709
关于这个芝士汉堡的原因，即使我还没有它。
reason about this cheeseburger, even though I don't yet have it.

59
00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.169
然后那些神奇的话，命令317。
And then those magical words, order 317.

60
00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:12.199
我走回柜台，手里拿着收据，上面印着317号订单。
And I walk back up to the counter, receipt in hand, order 317 printed on it.

61
00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.939
我把收据递给她，现在我得到了什么回报？
And I hand her my receipt, and what do I now get in return?

62
00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.299
我现在正在用这个承诺来换取价值本身。
I now am exchanging that promise for the value for the value itself.

63
00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.300
这是一个愚蠢的比喻，但仍然是一个比喻
This is a silly metaphor, but a metaphor nonetheless for

64
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.310
承诺发生了什么。
what is happening with promises.

65
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.030
承诺是一个量化的想法，我们需要一个地方
Promises are a quantification of the idea that we need a place

66
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.110
持有者消除时间是围绕价值的关注。
holder to eliminate time is the concern wrapped around the value.

67
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.870
我们需要一个容器围着它。
We need a container around it.

68
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.229
在编程语言中，我们称其为未来值。
In programming speak, we call that a future value.

69
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.860
这是一个最终会在某个未指明的点上实现的价值。
It's a value that will eventually at some unspecified point become fulfilled.

70
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.770
但与此同时
But in the meantime,

71
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.329
我们仍然需要能够以完全相同的方式对其进行推理。
we still need to be able to reason about it exactly the same way.

72
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.860
因为我们不想坐在那里等待和疑惑
Because we don't want to sit around waiting and wondering and

73
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.840
拥有所有这些不同逻辑的叉子。
having all these forks of different logic.

74
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.490
这就是使我们的代码变得复杂的原因。
That's the complexity that makes our code.

75
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.379
很难理解，很难维护，很难没有虫子。
Hard to understand, hard to maintain, hard to be bug free.

76
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.330
因此，承诺变成了一个包装在值周围的容器。
So the promise becomes a container that wraps around a value.

77
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.590
如果我们的承诺主要是通过
If that promises come to us primarily by way and

78
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.860
它们不是JavaScript的原创。
they're not original to JavaScript.

79
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.730
但它们主要是通过一种叫做E的语言来到我们身边的。
But they come to us primarily by way of a language called E.

80
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.019
TC39委员会的成员之一，马克·米勒。
One of the members of the TC 39 Committee, Mark Miller.

81
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.220
是E编程语言的创造者，在E中他们有这些东西
Is the creator of the E programming language, and in E they have these things

82
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.175
叫做期货，在E中，未来被它的价值所取代，
called futures, and in E a future is literally replaced by it's value,

83
00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:37.215
从字面上看，它是按其值进行交换的，但您可以执行操作
it's literally exchanged by its value but you can perform the operations

84
00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:42.360
您通常会直接、透明地对该值执行的操作。
that you would normally do against that value directly, transparently.

85
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.014
即使这个值还没有实际存在，你也可以开始编写它，
Even though the value isn't physically there yet, you can begin to compose it,

86
00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:49.353
您可以开始对执行操作。
you can begin to perform operations on.

87
00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:52.865
我们可以得到完全相同的东西，但他说你知道吗，
We can get quite the same thing but he said you know what,

88
00:04:52.865 --> 00:04:57.427
这真的很强大，我们应该给JavaScript带来一些东西
this is really powerful and we should bring something to JavaScript that

89
00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:01.569
允许人们对它的价值进行推理而忽略了时机。
allows people to reason about values it ignorance of the timing.

90
00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:07.339
价值观是重要的东西，构成价值观是重要的事情。
Values are the important thing and composing values is the important thing.

91
00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.949
如果听起来像是与函数式编程有关，那是因为它是。
If it sounds like it's kind of related to functional programming, that's cuz it is.

92
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.339
不是在这些术语中反省，而是承诺，不是他们的API，而是
Not to throwback in those terms but promises, not their API but

93
00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.040
他们的机制，他们基本上是一个单子。
their mechanism, they're basically a monad.

94
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.139
它们是函数式编程概念。
They're a functional programming concept.

95
00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.610
API并不像函数式程序员所希望的那样干净
The API is not quite as clean as a functional programmer would like and

96
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.269
已经有实验来创建更多的其他版本
there have been experiments to create other versions that are more

97
00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:35.529
功能健全，但原理仍然相同。
functionally sound, but the principle still the same.

98
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.590
所以如果它听起来很实用，那是因为它就是这样。
So if it sounds functional, it's because it is.

99
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.329
所以，这是对承诺的一种思考方式，就是它是一种未来价值。
So that's one way of thinking about a promise is that it's a future value.

100
00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:49.300
另一种思考承诺的方式是
Another way of thinking about a promise is that it

101
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.879
A颠倒了我们传统上使用的范式
an uninverts the paradigm that we're traditionally used

102
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:57.430
与其他一些本质上是异步的机制进行交互。
to interacting with some other mechanism that's going to be asynchronous in nature.

103
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.649
当我调用某个实用程序并且我知道该实用程序现在不会完成时，
When I call some utility and I know that utility's not going to finish now,

104
00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:03.569
它将在晚些时候结束。
it's going to finish at some later point.

105
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.959
当我称之为公用事业的时候。
When I call that utility.

106
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:08.920
我怎么能等着听呢？
How do I wait around to hear that?

107
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.689
我得给它回个电话。
I have to give it a call back.

108
00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.339
我得给你回个电话你还记得我说过
I have to pass a call back in and you remember I said,

109
00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.269
这是控制的反转。
that's inversion of control.

110
00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.980
当我在回调中结束我的程序的后半部分时
When I wrap up the second half of my program in a callback and

111
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.930
把它传给别人，我给他们延续控制权。
pass it to someone else, I give them the continuation control.

112
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.516
我已经颠倒了我所拥有的控制力。
And I've inverted the control that I have.

113
00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:27.589
但是如果我们可以颠倒这个范式呢？
But what if we could un-invert that paradigm?

114
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.800
如果我们可以，不倒相器而不是倒相器在第一位？
If we could, un-inverter rather not inverted in the first place?

115
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.329
而不是将调用传递回实用程序，
Rather than passing a call back to a utility,

116
00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:38.029
如果我们可以这样说，我要调用一些函数
what if we could say something like, I'm gonna call some function and

117
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:40.810
我知道它可能需要一段时间才能完成。
I know it might take a while for it to finish.

118
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.269
我要你回到我身边
I want you to return to me,

119
00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.920
当我打电话给公用事业公司的时候，我想让你给我一些东西。
when I call utility, I want you to give me back something.

120
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480
我要你给我一个事件监听器。
I want you to give me an event listener.

121
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.800
我可以订阅完成事件的事件侦听器。
An event listener that I can subscribe to a completion event.

122
00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.509
因此，我将监听事件的完成，而您只需激发该事件
So I'll listen for the completion of events and you just fire that event

123
00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.149
只要你准备好了，我就会通过这个事件监听器得到通知
whenever you're good and ready, and I'll be notified through this event listener

124
00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:02.569
你已经完成了你的工作，我知道是时候继续前进了。
that you've finished your work and I'll know it's time to move on.

125
00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.170
事实上，除了完成这件事之外，
In fact, in addition to being a completion of that,

126
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.670
我还可以监听错误事件。
I can also listen to an error event.

127
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.279
如果你有一些差事要通知我或其他你想通知我的事情
If you had some errand to notify me or other things that you want to notify me

128
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.550
关于，我可以简单的接收你的听众
about, I could simply receiving that listener back from you and

129
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.889
我知道这是一种尝试过的真实模式来接收并倾听。
I know that's a tried and true patterns to receive something and listen to it.

130
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.569
收听订阅上面的事件。
Listen subscribe to events on it.

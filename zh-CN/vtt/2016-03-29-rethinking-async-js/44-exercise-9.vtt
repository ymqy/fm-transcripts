&gt；&gt；Kyle：所以练习9和我们之前做的完全一样，
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So exercise nine is that exact same exercise that we did before,

3
00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:11.029
点击按钮和采样的那个。
the one with the clicking the buttons and the sampling.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.810
但现在我要试着看看你能不能想出如何用CSP做这个，好吗？
But now I'm gonna try to see if you can figure out how to do this with CSP, okay?

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.224
所以我们休息20分钟。
So we'll take a let's say 20 minute break.

00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:20.871
不是20分钟的休息。
Not 20 minute break.

7
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.899
但在这上面要花20分钟的工夫。
But a 20 minute work on this.

它比可观测的更具挑战性。
It's more challenging than the observables one.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.320
更像是大脑弯曲。
It's more brain bending.

10
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.390
从我刚才给你的幻灯片中你应该已经有了大部分你需要的东西。
You should have most of what you need from the slides that I just gave you.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.579
但当然可以随时联系并提出问题，
But certainly feel free to reach out and ask questions,

12
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.780

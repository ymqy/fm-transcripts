00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.229
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：如果我们看练习十，
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If we look at exercise ten,

3
00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.417
简单地说，我在练习10中想说的就是，
simply all that I'm saying with exercise ten is,

4
00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:16.117
我给了你其中一个实现的代码实际上是。
I gave you the code from one of the implementations is actually the.

5
00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:22.719
&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：我给了你来自的代码，哪个实现？
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I gave you the code from the, which implementation?

6
00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.940
异步的味道来自回购的实现。
The asynquence flavored implementation from the repo.

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.359
所以我已经给了你那个代码，
So I've given you that code already,

8
00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.850
它是在这个回购中建立的，它要求你首先做的是，
it's set up in this repo and what this is asking you to do is first,

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.939
研究这五种实现之间的异同。
to study the similarities and differences between these five implementations.

10
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.939
你不应该花那么多时间打开，因为你只有两个文件
Shouldn't take you that much time to open up because there's only two files that you

11
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.649
应该关心ui.js和Feeds.js，这两个实现中的每一个。
should care about the ui.js and the feeds.js, each of those implementations.

12
00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.859
所以打开这两个ui.js，然后
So open up ui.js in those two, and

13
00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.289
并排看，看看其中的一些不同之处。
look side by side look at some of the differences.

14
00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.950
只是没有深入研究这些差异，但是
Study those differences just not deeply, but

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.159
只是为了大致了解事情的进展情况。
just to get a rough sense of how things are going.

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.734
然后查看UI和
And then look at the ui and

17
00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:03.450
在练习10文件夹中的此资料库中提供的提要js。
feeds js that's presented in this repo that is in the exercise 10 folder.

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.060
这是异步风味的。
Which is the asynchronous flavored one.

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.390
现在你的任务是练习，如果你选择解决它。
Now your task for the exercise, should you choose to tackle it.

20
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.909
选择反应序列或
Pick either one of reactive sequences or

21
00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.939
CSP，从我们刚才讨论的内容中，你更喜欢哪一个。
CSP, whichever one you like more from what we just talked about.

22
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:16.530
我不在乎。
I don't care.

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.150
选择这两种中的任何一种，试着把我已经有的顺序式风味的那一种
Pick either one of those two and try to turn the asequence flavored one that I've

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.569
为你提供了这种抽象。
provided you into that abstraction.

25
00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.230
所以试着把它变成可观察到的反应序列一或
So try to take it and make it into the observable reactive sequences one or

26
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.909
尝试使它成为CSP之一，无论你喜欢哪一个。
try to make it into the CSP one, whichever one you'd like.

27
00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.210
这是极具挑战性的。
This is super challenging.

28
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.329
我会告诉你这些实现中的每一个，
I'll tell you that each of those implementations,

29
00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.120
当我第一次写的时候，花了我一天又一天的时间。
when I wrote them the first time, took me days and days.

30
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.270
所以我并不指望你能做到一个完整的事情，但是
So I'm not expecting you to get all the way there to a full complete thing, but

31
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.539
你也可以作弊，因为我给你提供了回购的固定版本，所以
you also can cheat cuz I've provided you the fixed versions on the repo, so

32
00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.870
如果你需要一些提示。
if you need some hints.

33
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.319
但真正的重点是在接下来的几分钟里，
But really the point here is to just spend the next few minutes,

34
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.509
我们可能会休息15分钟左右。
we'll probably break for 15 minutes or so.

35
00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.469
在接下来的15分钟里，试着研究这些差异，
Take the next 15 minutes and try to study these differences,

36
00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.120
试着用你的手对它做一些改变，这会更具反应性。
try your hand at making some changes to it that would be more reactive.

37
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.010
感受一下做我们一直在练习的事情是什么感觉
And get a sense of what it's like to do what we've practiced all along in

38
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.060
本研讨会，但在一个更复杂的应用程序的上下文中这样做
this workshop, but doing so in the context of a much more sophisticated app

39
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.409
而不是我们简单的小承诺演示。
than our simple little promises demo.

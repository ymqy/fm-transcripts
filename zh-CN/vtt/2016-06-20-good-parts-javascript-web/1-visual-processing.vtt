00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.504
[音乐]&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：让我给你一个类比
[MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Douglas: Let me give you an analogy

2
00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:07.078
来自视觉处理。
from visual processing.

3
00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:10.160
视觉处理是计算机图形学的对立面。
Visual processing is the opposite of computer graphics.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.259
在那里你可以从摄像机中获取信号并分析所有的像素
It's where you take a signal from a camera and analyze all the pixels and

5
00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.339
尝试确定场景中的所有对象是什么
try to determine what are all the objects in the scene and

6
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.010
它们在摄像机中是如何相对于彼此移动的。
how are they all moving relative to each other in the camera.

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.710
你需要能够解决这个问题才能在这个世界上行走
You need to be able to solve this problem in order to walk in the world and

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.984
这是一个非常困难的问题。
it's a really really difficult problem.

9
00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.429
但我们都能解决。
But we're all able to solve it.

10
00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.079
事实上，所有的动物都能解决这个问题。
And in fact all the animals are able to solve it.

11
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.100
我们之所以能做到这一点，是因为我们没有解决一般的问题
And the reason we're able to do that is because we don't solve the general problem

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.990
因为一般的问题很难。
because the general problem is hard.

13
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.329
相反，我们解决特殊问题。
Instead we solve special problems.

14
00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.460
更容易解决的问题，但有时会给出错误的答案。
Problems which are much easier to solve, but which sometimes give the wrong answer.

15
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.179
我们有技术
And we have techniques for

16
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.939
揭示我们错误的方式，我们称之为光学错觉。
revealing the ways in which we get this wrong, and we call them optical illusions.

17
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.600
这是麻省理工学院的Edward Adelson设计的幻觉
So this is an illusion designed by Edward Adelson of MIT.

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.270
这里我们有一个棋盘，有白方块和黑方块。
And here we've got a checkerboard with white squares and black squares.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.600
其中两个正方形被标记为A和B。
And two of the squares are labeled A and B.

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.859
结果发现这两个正方形的颜色完全相同。
And it turns out those two squares are exactly the same color.

21
00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.569
就像你们中的一些人可能会相信我告诉你们的那样，
As some of you may be seeing that you may believe that I'm telling you that,

22
00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.650
但你看到的是，一个明显是白色的，一个明显是黑色的。
but you're looking at that and one is clearly white and one is clearly black.

23
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.000
但事实上，它们都是那种颜色，它们都是那种中性灰色。
But in fact they are both that color, they're both that shade of neutral gray.

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.870
事实上，如果我把我的正方形覆盖在图片的顶部。
in fact if I overlay my square on top of the picture.

25
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.750
如果A和B是不同的颜色。
If A and B were different colors.

26
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.319
那么你应该会看到一些连续性的中断，对吧，
Then you should see some break in continuity, right,

27
00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.530
你应该看到一些边缘形成，但你没有。
you should see some edge forming and you don't.

28
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.229
现在你们中的许多人可能会看到一个渐变。
Now many of you may be seeing a gradient.

29
00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.500
谁看到了这里的梯度？
Who is seeing a gradient here?

30
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.712
看着颜色从黑白走向，那就来吧。
Seeing the colors going from black and white, that come on.

31
00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:44.626
是的，是的。
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:48.689
你的大脑在骗你，说没有梯度。
Your brain is lying to you, that there's not a gradient.

33
00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.759
它是那种颜色，它是一个纯色的正方形。
It is that color, it is a solid colored square.

34
00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.460
你知道这个形象的真相，但你仍然不能正确地看到它。
You know the truth of this image and yet you still can't see it correctly.

35
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.319
那是因为卡纳曼没有提到你大脑的另一个部分
It's because there's another part of your brain that Kahneman doesn't talk about

36
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.319
它处理的是反复无常，这是一件非常重要的事情
which deals with inconstancy, which is a really important thing to

37
00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.099
因为如果计算机系统变得不一致，
have because if a computer system becomes inconsistent,

38
00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219
它很有可能会失败，对吧？
there's a really good chance it's going to fail, right?

39
00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:11.780
只是[INAUDIBLE]的轰炸声。
It's just [INAUDIBLE] boom.

40
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.829
当生物系统迷惑时，他们不能承受失败的后果。
And biological systems can't afford to fail when they get confused.

41
00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.469
所以我们用的是这个系统，它会拒绝信息
So instead we've got this system, which will reject information which is

42
00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.340
如果它与我们的内在状态相矛盾，那么它就是通过我们的感官来自这个世界的。
coming from the world through our senses if it contradicts our internal state.

43
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.389
这就是为什么你不能正确地看到这一点。
And that's why you cannot see this correctly.

44
00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:35.469
因为它正在改变你的眼睛所看到的，以便符合
Because it is altering what you are seeing with your eyes in order to conform

45
00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.118
你的图像处理模式。
with your patterns of image processing.

46
00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.750
事实证明我们一直都在这样做，
And it turns out we do this all the time,

47
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.120
它不仅存在于视觉系统中，它也存在于一切事物中。
it's not just in the visual system, it's in everything.

48
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.889
这就是我们争论的原因
And that's why we argue so

49
00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.949
很大程度上是因为我们听不到对方在说什么。
much because we literally cannot hear what the other person is saying.

50
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.810
另一个人说了一些与我们矛盾的话，我们就会
The other person is saying something which contradicts us then we will

51
00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.020
曲解了他们说的话，这不是故意的，
misinterpret what they're saying, it's not intentional,

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.409
这只是我们为了抵抗矛盾而做的事情的一部分。
it's just part of what we're doing in order to resist inconsistency.

53
00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.219
这就是机制。
And this is the mechanism.

54
00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.219
所以这一切对广告业来说都不是新闻。
So it turns out none of this was news to the advertising industry.

55
00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.080
他们很久以前就发现他们可以
They had figured out a long time ago that they could

56
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.780
设计信息可以绕过直接进入肠道的头部
design messages which would bypass the head that would go straight to the gut

57
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.900
说服我们去买我们不需要的东西。
convincing us that we have to buy things that we don't need.

58
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.280
他们这么做已经很久了
They've been doing this for a long, long time.

59
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.513
Kahneman所做的就是提供理论来解释为什么这样做是可行的。
What Kahneman does is provide the theory which explains why that works.

60
00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:32.139
我认为没有人比烟草业更了解这一点。
And I don't think anybody understood this better than the tobacco industry.

61
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.930
因为你看烟草，好吧，那你怎么卖烟草？
Cuz you look at tobacco, okay, so how do you sell tobacco?

62
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.039
烟草是做什么的？
What what does tobacco do?

63
00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.389
它让你闻起来很难闻，它会让你的牙齿变黄，它会让你生病，而且
It makes you smell bad, it turns your teeth yellow, it makes you sick, and

64
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.550
然后它会杀了你。
then it kills you.

65
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.079
那么你如何说服人们，是的，让我们买一些烟草。
So how do you convince people, yeah, let's buy some tobacco.

66
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.229
并且他们通过创建能够混淆系统1的消息来做到这一点。
And they do it by creating messages which are able to confuse system 1.

67
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.889
系统1很容易混淆
System 1 is easily confused

68
00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.490
关于缓慢死亡和对你有好处的区别。
about the difference between slow death and good for you.

69
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.819
这就是我们用来编写计算机编程或
So that is the equipment that we have for writing computer programming or

70
00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.610
用于编写计算机程序。
for writing computer programs.

71
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.539
程序是人类制造的最复杂的东西。
And programs are the most complicated things that humans make.

72
00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:16.040
在人类经验中，没有任何其他东西是由许多微小的小东西组成的
There's nothing else in human experience which is composed of as many tiny little

73
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.180
所有必须完美结合的片段必须实时工作
pieces which all have to go together perfectly that have to work In real time

74
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.040
在动态情况下改变状态和改变输入。
with changing states and changing inputs in a dynamic situation.

75
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.009
其他任何东西都比不上我们在软件中所拥有的复杂性。
Nothing else comes anywhere close to the complexity that we have in software.

76
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.579
令人惊讶的是，我们能够做到这一点。
And it's amazing that we're able to manage this.

77
00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:34.519
但这真的很难。
But it's really hard.

78
00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.144
所以当第一台冯·诺依曼机器开始上线时，
So when the first Von Neumann machine started coming online,

79
00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:43.420
而且发现编程是非常困难的。
and it was discovered programming is really, really difficult.

80
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.776
所以有很多想法，我们需要想出一种方法
So there was a lot of thinking that we need to figure out a way in order to make

81
00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:50.899
更容易。
it easier.

82
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:55.269
实际上是为了让它变得不必要，因为否则电脑就不多了
In fact to make it unnecessary because otherwise the computers are not much

83
00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:56.470
对我们有用。
use to us.

84
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.829
于是开始了人工智能的研究。
And so that started research in artificial intelligence.

85
00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:03.240
人工智能最初的目标是
And the goal of artificial intelligence originally was to

86
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.139
找出一种让计算机编写自己的程序的方法，
figure out a way to have the computers write their own programs,

87
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.629
因为让人类来写实在是太难了。
because it was just too hard to have humans writing them.

88
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.379
人工智能取得了许多令人惊叹的成功，但他们完全失败了
AI has had a lot of amazing successes but they have failed completely at their

89
00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.149
最初的任务，你不能给电脑出问题
original mission, that you cannot give a problem to a computer and

90
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:23.670
请它编写解决该问题的程序。
ask it to write the program that solves that problem.

91
00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.379
如果是的话，我们会问计算机，我们写一个程序
If it were then we would ask the computer, well write a program that's

92
00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.689
比你好，一直这样直到他们成为我们的霸主。
better than you and keep doing that until they become our overlords.

93
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.480
而这并没有发生，计算机不知道如何编写程序，所以
And that hasn't happened, computers don't know how to write programs, so

94
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.040
我们给他们写信。
we write them.

95
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.519
所以由于人工智能的失败，
So as a result of the failure of AI,

96
00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:44.675
我们仍在手工编写程序。&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：So
we are still writing programs by hand. &gt;&gt; Douglas: So

97
00:05:44.675 --> 00:05:50.100
我们进行编程最重要的工具是编程语言。
the most important tool we have for doing programming is the programming language.

98
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.264
因为计算机真正擅长的一件事就是翻译一份正式的
Because one thing that computers are really good at, is translating one formal

99
00:05:54.264 --> 00:05:58.694
语言转换成另一种正式语言，这就是编程语言所做的。
language into another formal language and that's what programming languages do.

100
00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:03.125
它们允许我们在越来越高的抽象层次上写作，
They allow us to write at increasing higher levels of abstraction,

101
00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:07.959
在那里我们可以获得更多的杠杆，我们可以用更少的努力创造更多的工作。
where we get more leverage where we can create more work with less effort.

102
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.379
然后计算机或通过编程语言
And then the computer or through the programming language

103
00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.339
找出如何将其转换为计算机可以执行的形式。
figures out how to convert it into a form that the computer can execute.

104
00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.089
所以编程语言是非常重要的。
And so programming languages are really, really important.

105
00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:21.410
编程之所以如此
The thing that makes programming so

106
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.639
对完美的要求是极其困难的。
extremely difficult is the requirement for perfection.

107
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.069
程序必须在各个方面都绝对完美，
Programs have to be absolutely perfect in every aspect,

108
00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.149
对于所有可能的输入，对于所有时间的所有可能的状态，在每个细节中。
in every detail for all possible inputs, for all possible states for all time.

109
00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.009
我们与计算机的合同是，如果一个程序
And the contract we have with the computer, is that if a program

110
00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.980
并不是在所有这些方面都是完美的，计算机已经被许可做最坏的事情
is not perfect in all of those ways, the computer has licensed to do the worst

111
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.379
在最糟糕的时间可能发生的事情，这不是计算机的错误。
possible thing at the worst possible time and it is not the computer's fault.

112
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.170
这是谁的错？
Whose fault is it?

113
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.149
都是你的错。
It's your fault.

114
00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.409
为什么你给了我们一个你知道不完美的程序？
Why did you give us a program which you knew wasn't perfect?

115
00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.540
所以你会想得很好，好吧，因为对完美的要求，
So you'd think well okay, because of that requirement for perfection,

116
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.050
我们永远不会发布一个程序到生产，直到我们知道它是完美的。
we would never release a program to production until we know it's perfect.

117
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:05.100
我们不这么做有两个很好的理由。
And we don't do that for two really good reasons.

118
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.560
第一个是，我们永远不会将程序发布到生产环境中，并且
The first one is, we would never release a program to production, and

119
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.610
最终管理层会发现，或者
eventually management would figure, or

120
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.639
为什么我们要付钱给这些人，他们从来没有完成，让我们想出别的办法。
why are we paying these guys, they never finish, let's figure out something else.

121
00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.930
但第二个原因更隐蔽
But the second reason is much more insidious and

122
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.660
那就是我们没有完美的测试。
that is we have no test for perfection.

123
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.439
可能有人曾经创建了一个复杂的程序
It may be that someone once created a complex program

124
00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.160
这其实是完美的，没有办法知道。
that actually was perfect, there is no way to know.

125
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.800
没有完美的测试。
There is no test for perfection.

126
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.050
我们有不完美的测试，但没有完美的测试，所以
We have tests for imperfection but no tests for perfection, so

127
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.709
只是无从得知。
there's just no way to tell.

128
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.259
现在，我们的程序很可能没有一个是完美的。
Now, it's most likely that none of our programs are perfect.

129
00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:47.769
因此我们所做的就是将我们的程序投入生产，希望
And so what we do is we put our programs into production hoping that

130
00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:51.959
我们会在其他人发现之前发现它的问题并修复它，
we'll discover what's wrong with it and fix it before anyone else finds out,

131
00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:55.050
这很疯狂，但这是最先进的。
which is crazy, but that is the state of the art.

132
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.170
这是我们找到的最好的方法。
That is the best we have figured out how to do.

133
00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.680
所以我们用猎人和采集者的大脑来做这项工作。
So we're doing this work with the brains of hunters and gatherers.

134
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.800
这不是一个比喻。
And this is not a metaphor.

135
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.240
我们的大脑自上一次冰河时代以来就没有进化过。
Our brains have not evolved since the last ice age.

136
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.910
在那次经历中我们没有任何准备
And there was nothing in that experience to have prepared us for

137
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.800
计算机编程。
computer programming.

138
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.519
打猎和采集需要一套完全不同的技能。
Hunting and gathering required a completely different set of skills.

139
00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.170
所以，我们能够做到这一点是很令人惊讶的。
So, it's kind of amazing that we're able to do this at all.

140
00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:24.120
这是一种幸运，但在我们的进化中没有任何
It's sort of lucky, but there is nothing in our evolution which

141
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:27.500
已经为我们做好了准备。
has prepared us for that.

142
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.968
因此，我们正在利用我们所拥有的一切来做这件事。
So we're making use of everything we have in order to do this.

143
00:08:31.968 --> 00:08:36.615
所以编程显然是在利用系统2的头部，因为这就是
So programming obviously is making use of the head, of system 2 because that's where

144
00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:40.115
算法是活生生的，那就是我们做分析工作的地方，
the algorithms live, that's where we do the analytical stuff,

145
00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:44.338
这就是我们在状态和动态中做逻辑的地方，所有这些东西。
that's where we do the logic in the state and the dynamics, all of that stuff.

146
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.909
但我们不知道我们是怎么做到的。
But we don't understand how we do it.

147
00:08:47.909 --> 00:08:49.769
你们都想通了，但是
You have all figured it out but

148
00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:53.009
还不够好，你不能写下一份说明清单。
not well enough that you can write down a list of instructions.

149
00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:56.039
这就是你写计算机程序的方式，你做这些事情，然后
This is how you write a computer program, you do these things, and

150
00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:59.659
把它交给其他人，他们就可以阅读并按照步骤进行操作
hand it to someone else and they can read it and follow the steps and

151
00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.350
然后他们就可以写程序了。
then they can write programs.

152
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.399
我们不能这么做。
We can't do that.

153
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.600
不知何故，我们都想通了。
Somehow we have all figured it out.

154
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.379
但还不够好，我们不能告诉别人怎么做。
But not well enough that we could tell someone else how to do it.

155
00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:12.019
这就是为什么我们不能告诉机器怎么做，因为如果我们可以告诉其他人
And that's why we can't tell the machines how to do it because if we can tell other

156
00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:14.889
人类如何做到这一点，然后我们可以告诉机器如何做，但我们不知道。
human how to do it then we can tell machine how to do it, and we don't know.

157
00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:18.090
我们正在做的很多事情
And much of what we're doing

158
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.490
牵涉到直觉，因为我们总是在权衡取舍。
involves intuition because we're always making tradeoffs.

159
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.309
解决问题的最好方法是什么从来都不清楚。
It's never clear what the best approach to solving a problem is going to be.

160
00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:31.897
通常我们试图用不完全的知识来解决问题
And usually we're trying to solve a problem with incomplete knowledge of what

161
00:09:31.897 --> 00:09:33.157
解决之道就在眼前。
the solution is gong to be.

162
00:09:33.157 --> 00:09:37.474
所以我们不得不猜测，系统2不擅长猜测，
And so we have to guess, and system 2 is not good at guessing,

163
00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:39.600
系统1喜欢猜测。
system 1 loves to guess.

164
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.240
系统1会在不知道它在猜测的情况下进行猜测，它很擅长这一点。
System 1 will guess without knowing it's guessing, it's great at that.

165
00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:49.049
所以我们看到一个问题，我们会自上而下地研究它
And so we look at a problem and we'll look at it top down and

166
00:09:49.049 --> 00:09:52.080
自下而上，采取宏观观点和微观观点。
bottom up and take a macro view and micro view.

167
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.259
我们不断地改变我们的观点，直到最终出现一个程序。
We keep constantly shifting our point of view until eventually a program emerges.

168
00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:57.919
我们不知道我们是怎么做到的。
And we don't know how we do that.

169
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:05.044
所以系统2显然涉及其中，但我认为系统
So system 2 is obviously involved but I think system

170
00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:08.039
1也牵涉其中，这是我们不能记录它的部分原因。
1 is involved there as well, that's part of the reason why we can't document it.

171
00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:14.299
现在我没有证据支持这个论点，但我的直觉告诉我这是真的。
Now I have no evidence to support that argument but my gut tells me it's true.

172
00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:14.860
所以我相信。
So I believe it.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.769
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：我告诉你这个故事是因为我想
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I told you that story because I want to

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:07.349
向你介绍Kerckhoff一家。
introduce you the Kerckhoffs.

4
00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.669
Kerckhoff是个很棒的人
Kerckhoffs was an amazing guy.

5
00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.060
防弹装置爆炸后，他的情况变得很糟糕，
After the bulletproof thing exploded, things went really bad for him,

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.019
他的健康受到了影响，它只是，它变坏了。
his health suffered and it just, it went bad.

7
00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.070
但就在他和他们扯上关系之前，
But just before he got involved with them,

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.609
他写了第一本关于现代密码学的书。
he wrote the first book about modern cryptography.

9
00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.469
在Kerckhoff之前，密码学被理解为秘密代码的科学，
Prior to Kerckhoffs, cryptography was understood as the science of secret codes,

10
00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.960
一般写在纸上的代码。
generally codes written on pieces of paper.

11
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.390
Kerckhoff在电子通信的基础上重新发明了密码学
Kerckhoffs reinvented cryptography based on electronic communication

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.619
因为他们现在通过电报和房产发送信息
because they were now sending messages through the telegraph and the properties

13
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:46.170
电报的性质与纸张的性质完全不同。
of the telegraph are radically different from the properties of paper.

14
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.409
他解决了这个问题
And he worked this stuff out and

15
00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.729
提出了一套原则，今天人们仍然认为这些原则是正确的。
came up with a set of principles which are still understood to be true today.

16
00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.710
他是这些令人惊叹的思想家中的一员，他非常聪明，所以
He was one of these amazing thinkers who's just so smart and so

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.630
远远领先于他的时代。
far ahead of his time.

18
00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:05.420
所以他写的其中一个东西叫做Kerckhoff原则
So one of the things he wrote is called The Kerckhoffs Principle and

19
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.450
他说系统的设计不应该要求保密和
he said the design of a system should not require secrecy and

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.849
系统的妥协不应给通信人员带来不便。
compromise of the system should not inconvenience the correspondents.

21
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.099
让我来演示一下他在这里说的是什么。
So let me demonstrate what he's talking about here.

22
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.000
所以我们有两个通讯员爱丽丝和鲍勃，他们需要沟通和
So we have two correspondents Alice and Bob and they need to communicate and

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.200
他们不想在这样做的时候被观察到。
they don't want to be observed while they're doing that.

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.430
所以他们有一个密码系统。
So they have a cryptographic system.

25
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.900
在这个加密系统中，Alice获取她的消息，她的明文和
In this cryptographic system, Alice takes her message, her plain text and

26
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.420
把它放在加密机里。
puts it in an encryption machine.

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.430
她还将密钥放入加密机，然后输出密文。
She also puts a key into the encryption machine and out comes a cipher-text.

28
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.689
然后她将密文传输给Bob和
She then transmits the cipher-text to Bob and

29
00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.200
这是完全有可能的电线被观察到，任何人都可以看到它。
it's entirely possible that that wire is being observed and anybody can see it.

30
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.400
Bob收到密文，他把它放进他的解密机，可能是
Bob receives the cipher-text, he puts it in his decryption machine which may be

31
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.079
与爱丽丝的加密机相同并且也放入相同的密钥，
identical to Alice's encryption machine and also puts in the same key,

32
00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.099
他们在之前的一次会面中交换了这一点，这使他能够获得平原
which they exchanged in a prior meeting, and that allows him to obtain the plain

33
00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.719
文本，这基本上就是所有密码系统的工作方式。
text and this is basically how all cryptographic systems work.

34
00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.969
Kerckhoff说的那件事
The thing that Kerckhoffs said which was so

35
00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.490
令人惊讶的是，加密机中没有秘密。
amazing was that there are no secrets in the encryption machine.

36
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.210
系统中唯一的秘密是密钥和
The only secret in the system is the key and

37
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.060
我仍然看到今天的人们，学者们说，我们应该尽量保持
I still see people today, academics who are saying, we should try to keep as

38
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.620
为了挫败攻击者，我们的大部分系统都是私有的。
much of our system private as we can in order to frustrate the attackers.

39
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.164
Kerckhoff说不，保护好钥匙，这就是你要做的。
Kerckhoffs said no, just protect the keys, that's all you have to do.

40
00:02:37.164 --> 00:02:43.340
他是对的，因为在默默无闻中没有安全。
And he was right and he was right because there is no security in obscurity.

41
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.770
事实证明，你拥有的秘密越多，就越难保守
And it turns out the more secrets you have, the harder they are to keep and

42
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.259
只是保证钥匙的安全真的很难。
just keeping the keys safe is really hard.

43
00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.329
所以你应该把所有的注意力都集中在这上面。
So you should focus all of your attention on that.

44
00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.170
有些人接受柯克霍夫原则
There are some people who take The Kerckhoffs Principle so

45
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.699
至于说我们应该发布除了密钥之外的关于我们系统的所有内容，
far as to say we should publish everything about our system except our keys,

46
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.860
这种态度的好处是你从来不会困惑
the good thing about that attitude is you're never confused about

47
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.620
你系统中的重要秘密是什么？
what are the important secrets in your system.

48
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.960
所以密码术不是安全的，而是
So cryptography is not security but

49
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.528
密码学家思考问题的方式
the way that cryptographers think about problems

50
00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.020
是一种非常有用的思维方式，我们也应该这样思考。
Is a really useful way of thinking and we should think like that too.

51
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.360
所以我会试着教你像密码学家一样思考。
So I'm gonna try to teach you to think like a cryptographer.

52
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.569
我将通过教授加密系统来做到这一点
I'm gonna do that by teaching about a cryptographic system

53
00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.780
叫做一次性垫子。
called the One Time Pad.

54
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.490
这是唯一保证真实的加密系统
This is the only cryptographic system which is guaranteed to be truly

55
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.009
牢不可破。
unbreakable.

56
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.270
在所有其他加密系统中，如果您有足够的时间和
In all other cryptographic systems, if you have enough time and

57
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.400
足够的计算机能力，最终你可以蛮力，尝试每一个键和
enough computer power, eventually you can brute force, try every key and

58
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.610
最终你会打破这个系统。
eventually you'll break the system.

59
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.586
不可能与一个系统，保证牢不可破，这是非常好的。
Not possible with a system, guaranteed unbreakable which is pretty nice.

60
00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:54.349
有传言说白宫和
There are rumours that the hotline between the White House and

61
00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.949
克里姆林宫是用一次性密码板加密的。
the Kremlin is encrypted with the One Time Pad.

62
00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.629
这就是它的工作原理。
So this is how it works.

63
00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.590
我们有很多必须遵守的规则。
We have a number of rules that we have to follow.

64
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.490
第一个是密钥必须始终保持秘密。
The first one is that the key must always remain secret.

65
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.444
每一个密码系统都是如此。
This is true of every cryptographic system.

66
00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:13.754
第二，密钥必须至少与纯文本一样长。
Number two, the key must be at least as long as the plain text.

67
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.965
这真的很不寻常。
Now this is really unusual.

68
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:19.834
在大多数密码系统中，密钥是某种固定大小的，并且
In most cryptographic systems, the key is some fixed size and

69
00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:23.035
消息往往比密钥长得多。
the messages tend to be much longer than the key.

70
00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:26.560
这一条说密钥必须至少和消息一样长。
This one says the key has to be at least as long as the message.

71
00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.410
然后通过异或运算得到密文
Then the cypher text is obtained by Exclusive-ORing

72
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.605
纯文本和密钥。
the plain text and the key.

73
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:32.209
这就是算法。
That is the algorithm.

74
00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:36.590
这就是系统的实现，所以它非常简单。
That is the implementation of the system, so it's really, really simple.

75
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.750
所以让我向你们演示一下。
So let me demonstrate it to you.

76
00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.649
这是我的纯文本。
This my plain text.

77
00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:41.889
这是JSON徽标。
This is the JSON logo.

78
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.983
我用它是因为我可以。
I'm using it because I can.

79
00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:49.259
通常你认为一个纯文本就是一个文本，但这是一个数组和
Usually you think of a plain text as being a text, but this is an array of ones and

80
00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.079
零，对吧？
zeros, right?

81
00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:52.319
所以我们可以加密它。
So we can encrypt that.

82
00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.000
这是我的钥匙。
This is my key.

83
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.529
密钥与消息的大小相同。
The key is the same size as the message.

84
00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.680
我要对它们进行异或运算，如果我做对了，
I'm going to Exclusive-OR them together and if I do this correctly,

85
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.220
你不应该看到任何迹象，任何幽灵，任何原始信息的窃窃私语。
you should not see any sign, any ghost, any whisper of the original message.

86
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.970
如果信息被完全遮蔽，隐藏在噪音中，
If a message is completely obscured, hidden in the noise,

87
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.360
那么我已经正确加密了。
then I have encrypted it correctly.

88
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.620
下一个规则是密钥必须是完全随机的，或者
The next rule says that the key must be perfectly random or

89
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.980
密码随机。
cryptographically random.

90
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.459
获得这种随机性是很难的。
Getting that kind of randomness is hard.

91
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:25.079
现在我费了很大的劲才把它放进钥匙里。
Now I went to a lot of trouble to get that into my key.

92
00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:27.750
所以让我告诉你如果你不这么做会发生什么。
So let me show you what happens if you don't.

93
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.800
所以这是一把钥匙，它看起来就像我先给你看的那把钥匙，
So this is a key, it looks just like the key I showed you first,

94
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.500
除了我在Photoshop里用噪音滤镜做的这个，好吧
except I made this one in Photoshop with a noise filter, okay and

95
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.970
Photoshop的噪波过滤器不保证是加密随机的。
Photoshop's noise filters are not guaranteed to be cryptographically random.

96
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.740
所以如果我用这个弱键对纯文本进行异或，你可以看到它，对吗？
So if I Exclusive-OR my plain text with this weak key, you can see it, right?

97
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.740
漏水了。
It's leaking through.

98
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.139
这就是地窖分析师在破解密码时所寻找的东西。
This is what crypt analysts are looking for when they're breaking codes.

99
00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.980
他们在寻找任何一种模式，
They're looking for any kind of pattern,

100
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.170
任何通过噪音泄漏的信号。
any kind of signal that's leaking through the noise.

101
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.220
你正在用你的大脑破解一个牢不可破的代码，
You are breaking an unbreakable code with your brain,

102
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.370
你甚至都不努力工作。
and you're not even working hard at it.

103
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.519
你能做到这一点的原因是你的视觉系统
And the reason you're able to do that is your visual system

104
00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.209
在分离信号和噪声方面非常有效，并且
is extremely effective at separating signal from noise, and

105
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.790
这就是密码分析员在试图破解代码时所做的事情。
that's what crypt analysts do when they're trying to break a code.

106
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.660
下一个规则非常重要，它是系统的名称。
The next rule is so important, it is the name of the system.

107
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.899
一个密钥绝不能使用多次。
A key must never be used more than once.

108
00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:31.939
所以系统如何使用的比喻是我将打印
So the metaphor for how the system is used is I will print

109
00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.149
两本相同的随机数书。
two identical books of random numbers.

110
00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:37.548
我会留着一个，我会给你另一个。
I will keep one, I will give you the other one.

111
00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:42.550
当我想给你加密信息的时候，我会拿第一张纸，
When I want to encrypt a message to you, I will take the first sheet,

112
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.649
我会把它撕掉，我会用它加密，然后我会毁掉它。
I will tear it out, I will encrypt with it, I will then destroy it.

113
00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:49.399
当您收到消息时，您将采取相应的
When you receive the message, you will take the corresponding

114
00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.699
从你的书里拿出一张纸，你会用它解密，然后你会毁掉它。
sheet out of your book, you will decrypt with it, and you will destroy it.

115
00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.439
你再也不会用它了。
You will never use it again.

116
00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.178
这就是为什么它被称为一次性垫子。
That's why it's called the One Time Pad.

117
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.829
那么，如果我们违反了这条规则，会发生什么呢？
So what happens if we violate that rule?

118
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.029
这是我的照片
So this is a picture of me.

119
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:04.720
这是在伊斯坦布尔拍摄的。
This was taken in Istanbul.

120
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.040
我用它是因为我可以。
I'm using it because I can.

121
00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.779
你会意识到这是我给你看的第一把钥匙。
This, you'll recognise is the first key that I showed you.

122
00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.319
这是第一把好钥匙
This is the first good key and

123
00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:18.870
我要用这个加密我的图片，再一次，它是完全隐藏的。
I'm going to encrypt my picture with that and again, it's completely hidden.

124
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.449
我现在要对这个进行异或运算
I'm now going to Exclusive-OR this one with

125
00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.370
我得到的第一个密文。
the first cipher text that I obtained.

126
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.000
所发生的是因为它们各自与一个密钥进行异或运算，
And what happens is because they each are Exclusive-ORed with a key,

127
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.100
密钥将取消，剩下的两条消息是异或的
the key will cancel out and I'm left with the two messages Exclusive-ORed

128
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.430
彼此之间没有安全保障。
with each other and there is no security in that.

129
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.019
所以密码术不是安全的，
So cryptography is not security,

130
00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:43.810
但是密码学可以教给我们关于安全的东西。
but cryptography can teach us stuff about security.

131
00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:47.759
我发现的是
It's something I've found is that

132
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.199
我们经常错误地思考如何使用密码学。
often we think incorrectly about how to use cryptography.

133
00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.351
如果我看到某人的系统
If I'm looking at someone's system and

134
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:57.430
它们中有明显的安全漏洞，我指出它们
there are obvious security vulnerabilities in them and I point them out to

135
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.949
架构师，架构师的第一反应是，我们需要加密一些东西。
the architect, the architect's first response is, we need to encrypt something.

136
00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:04.779
结果证明是行不通的。
That turns out not to work.

137
00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:09.040
但是像密码学家一样思考，这确实有效
But thinking like cryptographers, that does work and

138
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.430
他们用来思考的工具之一
one of the tools that they use for thinking

139
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.350
他们有一组角色用来对他们的系统进行推理。
is they have a cast of characters who they use for reasoning about their systems.

140
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.410
我们已经见过爱丽丝和鲍勃了。
We've already met Alice and Bob.

141
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.639
它们是密码学节目中的标准人物，
They are standard characters in the cryptographic show,

142
00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:24.399
但是还有很多其他的角色。
but there are lots of other characters.

143
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.500
例如，有夏娃。
For example, there is Eve.

144
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.990
伊芙是个窃听者。
Eve is an eavesdropper.

145
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.149
例如，EVE可能有数据包嗅探器，EVE可能是NSA。
Eve might have a packet sniffer and Eve might be NSA for example.

146
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.450
伊芙在看爱丽丝和爱丽丝之间的一切
Eve is looking at everything that's going between Alice and

147
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.440
Bob和Eve希望积累足够的东西
Bob, and Eve is hoping to accumulate enough stuff that

148
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.950
最终她会有足够的信息来破坏他们的系统或者至少
eventually she'll have enough information to break their system or at least

149
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.308
能够观察他们的通信模式并进行流量分析。
be able to observe the pattern of their communication and do a traffic analysis.

150
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.470
然后是马洛里
Then there is Mallory.

151
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.629
马洛里可以做男人在中间，男人在中间攻击。
Mallory can do man in the middle of it, man in the middle attacks.

152
00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:03.590
Mallory可能正在操作公共热点，因此Bob连接
Mallory might be operating a public hot spot, and so Bob connects

153
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.080
马洛里的网络以为他会和爱丽丝连接，但是
to Mallory's network thinking that he's gonna connect to Alice, but

154
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.919
他实际上和Mallory有联系。
he's actually connected to Mallory.

155
00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:14.919
Mallory连接到Alice，Bob尝试登录。
Mallory connects to Alice and Bob tries to log in.

156
00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:19.740
Mallory问Bob，你的密码是什么，Mallory连接到Alice。
Mallory asks Bob, what's your password, Mallory connects to Alice.

157
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.620
爱丽丝说你的密码是什么，马洛里把鲍勃的密码给了爱丽丝。
Alice says what's your password, Mallory gives Bob's password to Alice.

158
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.659
现在他告诉爱丽丝，请把我的钱转过来。
Now he tells Alice, please transfer my funds.

159
00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.639
马洛里对爱丽丝说，请更改我的密码。
Mallory says to Alice, please change my password.

160
00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:32.629
Mallory对Bob说，很抱歉我们现在下来了，请稍后再来。
Mallory says to Bob, I'm sorry we're down right now, please come back later.

161
00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:35.360
这是我们应该担心的吗？
Is that something we should be worried about?

162
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.379
是的，我们应该担心这个，是的。
Yeah, we should be worried about that, yeah.

163
00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:42.056
最后，在我自己的实践中，我有一个角色，我称之为撒旦。
And then finally in my own practice, I have a character I call Satan.

164
00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:47.850
撒旦完全是恶毒的。
Satan is totally malicious.

165
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.953
他非常强大，他非常聪明，他非常坚定。
He was very, very powerful, he is very, very smart, he's very, very determined.

166
00:09:51.953 --> 00:09:57.080
他有资金，他有工具，他想伤害我们和我们的客户。
And he's financed, he's got the tools and he wants to hurt us and our customers.

167
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.049
有些人对他采取的方法就是说好，
The approach that some people take to him is to say well,

168
00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:04.669
我们不会让他和我们联系。
we won't let him connect to us.

169
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.399
你知道如果你是撒旦，你就不能连接。
You know if you're Satan, you can't connect.

170
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.490
这就是所谓的黑名单，那是行不通的。
That's called a blacklist and that doesn't work.

171
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.820
在互联网上，很容易就能创造出新的身份
On the Internet, it is so easy to create new identities that

172
00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:19.830
你不能这么做，因为他会变成另一个人。
you can't do that because he'll just be somebody else.

173
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.480
所以另一种方法是我们将允许每个人都与我们联系
So the other approach is we will allow everybody to connect to us who

174
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.080
不是撒旦。
is not Satan.

175
00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:28.820
这是一个白名单，在这种情况下也不起作用。
That's a white list and that doesn't work either in this case.

176
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.549
唯一起作用的就是认识到撒旦
The only thing that works is recognising that Satan

177
00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:37.519
会和我们联系，他会对我们做什么
is going to connect to us and he is going to do to us and

178
00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:42.700
我们的客户，无论我们允许他对我们和我们的客户做什么。
our customers whatever we allow him to do to us and our customers.

179
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.250
所以我们有责任把每件事都做好，这样我们的能力
And so we have a responsibility to do everything right so that the capabilities

180
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.169
我们给予撒旦的东西是如此有限，如此软弱，以至于他不能伤害我们。
that we give to Satan are so limited and so weak that he cannot cause us harm.

181
00:10:54.169 --> 00:10:56.870
这是唯一有效的方法。
That is the only thing that works.

182
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.289
其他的都不管用。
Nothing else works.

183
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:06.279
正因为如此，我们做出的每一个决定都必须考虑到安全因素。
So because of that, security must be factored into every decision we make.

184
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:09.470
我们所做的一切都有安全隐患
Everything we do has security implications and

185
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.460
对撒旦来说，要么能让事情变得更好，要么让事情变得更糟。
can either make things better or worse for Satan.

186
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:19.009
不安全感的一个重要来源是我们会回去
One big source of insecurity is the idea that we'll go back and

187
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:20.450
以后再保证安全。
make it secure later.

188
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.299
很常见的是，正在建造某件东西的工程师们会苦思冥想
It's very common that engineers who are building something will think the hard

189
00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:27.850
一部分是让系统启动，或者让盒子说话，或者
part is going to be to get the systems to boot, or the boxes to talk, or

190
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.950
屏幕上的像素。
the pixels on the screen.

191
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.090
一旦我们这样做了，2，0将返回并添加安全性。
Once we've done that, 2,0 will go back and add security.

192
00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:34.799
结果发现这不管用。
Turns out that doesn't work.

193
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.980
安全是一件很难改造的事情。
Security is a really hard thing to retrofit.

194
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.409
你需要在一开始就把事情做好，而且一直都是这样。
You need to get the stuff right at the beginning and all along all the time.

195
00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:48.309
你不能增加安全性，就像你不能增加可靠性一样。
You can't add security just as you can't add reliability.

196
00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:50.740
这些都是必须删除的东西。
These are things that have to be removed.

197
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.850
你必须消除不安全感。
That you have to remove insecurity.

198
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.120
你必须消除不可靠。
You have to remove unreliability.

199
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.909
您不能添加它们。
You can't add them.

200
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.309
活到这一点并不能保证未来的生存。
Having survived to this point does not guarantee future survival.

201
00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:05.070
所有在网上做生意的人都受到了攻击
Everybody who does business on the web has been under attacked

202
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.730
自从万维网诞生以来，他们还没有摧毁我们，但是
since the beginning of the web and they have not destroyed us yet, but

203
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.679
这并不能保证他们不会，所以你必须时刻保持警惕。
that does not guarantee that they won't and so you have to always remain vigilant.

204
00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.835
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：不可能是不可能的，所以
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: The impossible is not possible, so

205
00:12:18.835 --> 00:12:23.220
不要指望不可能的手段来保护你。
don't expect impossible means to protect you.

206
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.259
如果一个措施无效，它就是无效的，并且
If a measure is not effective, it is ineffective, and

207
00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:29.658
我们不应该在它上面浪费任何时间或注意力。
we should not be wasting any time or attention on it.

208
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.960
不要试图禁止你不能阻止的事情。
Don't attempt to prohibit what you can't prevent.

209
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.840
而你不能阻止的就是你允许的。
And what you don't prevent, you allow.

210
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.360
错误的安全性比没有安全性更糟糕，因为如果您
False security is worse than no security because if you

211
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.870
知道你不安全，你会谨慎，如果你认为你安全
know you're not secure, you'll be cautious and if you think you're secure and

212
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.450
你不是，你会鲁莽的。
you're not, you will be reckless.

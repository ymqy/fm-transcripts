00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.956
[音乐]
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:07.331
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：ECMAScript 5，新零件。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: ECMAScript 5, The New Parts.

3
00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:12.192
所以第五版的完整实现现在已经全部完成了
So complete implementations of the fifth edition are now in all

4
00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:15.598
最好的Web浏览器，也在IE10中。
the best web browsers, and also in IE10.

5
00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:19.925
所以，它几乎无处不在。
So, it's almost everywhere.

6
00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:23.429
因此，再次回顾标准的历史，
So again, to review the history of the standards,

7
00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.187
第三版于1999年12月批准。
the third edition was ratified in December 1999.

8
00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:32.137
第四版的工作几乎是在那之前一年开始的。
Work on the fourth editions started almost a year before that.

9
00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:36.268
第四版试图解决我认为的一些问题
The fourth edition was attempting to solve some problems that I think

10
00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.487
都是不必要的。
were unnecessary.

11
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:42.240
最终，它变得如此庞大，如此复杂，以至于无法完成。
And eventually, it got so big and so complicated that it was not completable.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.915
那个项目连续十年每年都下滑一次。
That project slipped a year per year for ten years.

13
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:50.899
所以它最终被遗弃了，取而代之的是，
So it was eventually abandoned and instead,

14
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.529
我们做了第五版，从工作标题ES3.1开始，
we did the fifth Edition which started with a working title ES3.1,

15
00:00:55.529 --> 00:01:00.945
表明这将是一个不那么雄心勃勃的尝试，以增加善意
indicating that it was going to be a much less ambitious attempt at adding goodness

16
00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:05.914
第三版增加了两种语言或描述了两种语言。
to the third edition and it adds two languages or describes two languages.

17
00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:09.760
默认语言和严格语言。
The default language and the strict language.

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.109
在这两种语言中，我建议不要使用默认语言，而是使用严格的
And of the two, I recommend not using the default language, but using the strict

19
00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:19.170
语言是独有的，我们稍后将讨论严格语言中的内容。
language exclusively and we'll talk later about what's in the strict language.

20
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.609
因此，ECMAScript 5项目的目标是制作更好的JavaScript。
So, that the goal of the ECMAScript 5 project was to make a better JavaScript.

21
00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.980
有很多人希望我们不能做出更好的JavaScript，但是
There are a lot of people who wanted us to not make a better JavaScript, but

22
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.099
创造一种不同的语言，当然有很好的论据
to make a different language and there's certainly good arguments for

23
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.750
这样做，但我认为标准化不是尝试这样做的正确位置。
doing that, but I think standardization is not the correct place to try to do that.

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.387
所以我们没有尝试去做一件大事，而是尝试去做很多小事。
So instead of trying to do a big thing, we tried to do a lot of little things.

25
00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:44.408
我们试图使标准更符合实际。
We tried to make the standard conform better to reality.

26
00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:47.926
有些情况下标准说，
There are some cases where the standard said,

27
00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:53.441
实现必须做到这一点，没有一个实现做到了这一点。
implementations must do this and none of the implementations did that.

28
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.504
所以我们说，好的，标准显然是错误的。
So we said, okay, well, the standards obviously wrong.

29
00:01:56.504 --> 00:01:59.049
我们应该使标准符合人们实际做的事情。
We should make the standard conform to what people actually do.

30
00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.030
我们应该努力使浏览器更好地相互兼容。
We should try to make the browsers conform better to each other.

31
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.438
在有些情况下，三个浏览器制造商会用一种方式来做事情，并且
There are cases where three browser makers would do things one way and

32
00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:09.449
微软会用另一种方式做事情。
Microsoft would do things another way.

33
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.627
微软非常慷慨地同意做其他人都在做的事情，
Microsoft very generously agreed to do what everybody else was doing,

34
00:02:14.627 --> 00:02:16.622
那是一件非常美好的事情。
that was a very nice thing.

35
00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:19.235
在所有浏览器都不同意的情况下，
In cases where all of the browsers disagreed,

36
00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:21.915
每个浏览器都做了不同的事情，
where every browser did something different,

37
00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:25.402
我们将其作为修正标准深层内容的许可证。
we took that as license to fix something deep in the standard.

38
00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:29.759
如果每个浏览器都做了一些不同的事情，我们假设网络并不在意。
That we assume that the web doesn't care, if every browser does something different.

39
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.889
在这种情况下，我们可以进去做更深层次的改变。
In that case, we can go in and do deeper changes.

40
00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.348
作为所有这些工作的结果，互操作性得到了改进。
As a result of all of this work, interoperability is improved.

41
00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:41.944
JavaScript已经非常擅长Write Once Run Everywhere。
JavaScript was already very good at write once run everywhere.

42
00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:43.530
有了ES5，它会变得更好。
With ES5, it gets even better.

43
00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:51.729
所以我们ES5的首要目标是不要破坏网络，这真的是
So our number one goal for ES5 was don't break the web and that's a really

44
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:57.530
目标很难保持，因为任何时候你改变了什么，就会有东西打破。
difficult goal to keep, because any time you change anything, something will break.

45
00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:04.923
我们确实在ES5上打破了一些东西，但我们真的很努力不去做。
And we did break some stuff with ES5, but we tried really hard not to.

46
00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:10.002
现在你可以像我一样争辩，外面有很多东西，
Now you could argue as I did, there is a lot of stuff out there,

47
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:15.592
应该打破，但我们试着不打破甚至那些东西。
which deserves to break, but we tried not to break even that stuff.

48
00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:19.316
我们希望为语言的用户改进语言。
We wanted to improve the language for the users of the language.

49
00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:23.516
大多数对JavaScript持批评态度的人都不使用这种语言和
Most of the critics of JavaScript are people who do not use the language and

50
00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:26.794
即使我们照他们说的做，也不会使用它。
would not use it even if we did everything they told us to.

51
00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:30.412
所以我们尽量不要听他们太多，并不总是成功。
So we tried not to listen to them too much, not always successfully.

52
00:03:30.412 --> 00:03:33.509
我们试着听你的。
We tried instead to listen to you.

53
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.753
我们非常关注第三方安全或mashup。
We paid a lot of attention to third party security or mash ups.

54
00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:42.229
我们希望您可以将其他人的代码添加到您的页面中，并且
We want to make it possible for you to add someone else's code to your page and

55
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.949
不要违反您的安全或客户的安全。
have it not violate your security or your customer's security.

56
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.275
我们决定不去保护愚蠢的人不受他们自己的伤害，
We decided not to try to protect stupid people from themselves,

57
00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:53.155
因为那太难了。
because that is just too hard.

58
00:03:56.454 --> 00:04:00.971
所以我们，事实上，增加了一些新的方法，让愚蠢的人可以做一些极其愚蠢的事情
So we, in fact, added new ways that stupid people can do outrageously stupid things

59
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.145
我们稍后会讲到这一点。
and we'll get to that little bit later.

60
00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:09.074
我们决定没有新的语法，原因是
And we decided to have no new syntax and the reason for that is

61
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:13.739
在我们做这项工作的时候，IE6仍然是占主导地位的浏览器。
that at the time that we were doing this work, IE6 was still the dominant browser.

62
00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.605
我们担心的是如果我们推出新版本的语言
And our concern was that if we launched a new version of the language and

63
00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:21.435
如果IE6仍然占主导地位，
if IE6 is still dominant,

64
00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:26.848
然后如果新语言的值依赖于语法并且它将失败，
then if the value of that new language depended on syntax and it's going to fail,

65
00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:32.363
因为每一个新功能都意味着彻底的失败，而这对你一点帮助都没有。
because every new feature means total failure and that's not helping you at all.

66
00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:36.990
因此，我们试图在不改变的情况下为语言增加尽可能多的价值
So, we tried to add as much value to the language as we could without changing

67
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.742
语言的语法。
the syntax of the language.

68
00:04:38.742 --> 00:04:42.066
希望最终我们能解决IE问题
Hoping that eventually we would solve the IE problem and

69
00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:46.459
那么该语言的后续版本将能够更自由地使用语法。
then later editions of the language would be able to be freer with syntax.

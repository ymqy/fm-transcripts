[音乐]

2
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.991
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：早上好，我是Doug Crockford。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So good morning, I'm Doug Crockford.

3
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.420
这是三天的好部分。
This is three days of the good parts.

4
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.439
出乎意料的是，JavaScript成为了，也许是最重要的编程
Unexpectedly, JavaScript has become, perhaps the most important programming

5
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:50.020
世界上最令人惊讶的语言，
language in the world, which is surprising,

6
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.969
因为它也是世界上最容易被误解的编程语言，
because it's also the world's most misunderstood programming language,

7
00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.079
这周我们会试着解决一些问题。
which we'll try to fix some of that this week.

8
00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.009
这就是课程的大纲。
So, this is the outline for the course.

9
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.670
今天将是一系列的五堂课，我对此表示歉意。
Today is going to be a series of five lectures and I apologize for that.

10
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.694
我需要给你很多信息
There's a lot of information I need to give you and

11
00:01:05.694 --> 00:01:08.150
我知道的唯一方法就是说出来。
the only way I know to do that is to say it.

12
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.079
所以你得听我整天抱怨，但是
So you're gonna have to listen to me whining on all day, but

13
00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.129
明天会更好。
tomorrow will be much better.

14
00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:15.897
明天我们要去研讨会。
Tomorrow, we're gonna workshop.

15
00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:17.519
我们会在函数上玩得很开心。
We're gonna have fun with functions.

16
00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.594
你可以写程序，这会很棒的。
You could be writing programs and it's gonna be great.

17
00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:22.189
明天我们会过得更好。
We're gonna have a much better time tomorrow.

18
00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.542
然后在第三天，我们将做一些更有趣的函数，
Then on the third day, we'll do some more fun with functions,

19
00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.460
然后我们也来看一些非常重要的话题。
then we'll also look at some very important topics.

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.582
安全性、异步性，这是您必须处理的许多问题，
Security, asynchronicity, which is something you have to deal on a lot with,

21
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:39.010
特别是在服务器和展望这种语言的未来的更好的部分中
especially in servers and the better parts looking at the future of this language and

22
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.771
其他语言，使之听起来令人愉快。
other languages So that sound agreeable.

23
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:46.939
所以，让我们从第一部分的编程风格和你的大脑开始。
So, let's begin with part one programming style and your brain.

24
00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.420
这是两个似乎毫无关系的话题。
These are two topics which appear to have nothing to do with each other.

25
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.512
编程风格是编译器注意到的程序的一部分
Programming Style is the part of your program that the compiler notice and

26
00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:57.878
有些人认为因为编译器不关心，
some people think that because the compiler doesn't care,

27
00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:02.250
你不应该在意任何款式和其他款式一样好-这只是品味的问题。
you shouldn't care any styles as good as another it's just a matter of taste.

28
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.426
我会试着说服你不是这样的
I'm gonna try to persuade you that that is not the case,

29
00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:09.770
有些风格明显优于其他风格，然后是你的大脑。
that some styles are significantly better than others and then your brain.

30
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.313
你的大脑就是你头骨里的那一大块肉，你用它来思考和思考
Your brain is that big wad of meat in your skull that you think with and

31
00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:18.870
这两件事之间有什么可能的联系呢？
what possible connection could there be between these two things?

32
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.400
嗯，结果是有一种联系，一种令人惊讶而又重要的联系。
Well, turns out there is a connection, a surprising and important one.

33
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.597
我会歪曲丹尼尔·卡尼曼的工作
I'm gonna be misrepresenting the work of Daniel Kahneman,

34
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:27.420
诺贝尔奖获得者心理学家。
the Nobel Winning Psychologist.

35
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.520
现在，诺贝尔没有颁发心理学奖。
Now, Nobel does not give a prize for psychology.

36
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.177
所以他们给了他经济学奖，但他不是经济学家，但是
So they gave him the award for economics, but he's not an economist, but

37
00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:38.079
他发现经济学的一个基本假设是站不住脚的。
he found that one of the fundamental assumptions of economics doesn't hold.

38
00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.353
也就是说，在任何事务中，
That is that in any transaction,

39
00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:44.829
可以期望一个政党追求自己的最佳利益。
a party can be expected to pursue their own best interests.

40
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.376
Kahneman表明，如果一个政党是一个人，则情况并非如此，
Kahneman shows this is not the case if a party is a human being,

41
00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:52.347
因为人类的思维方式与经济学家的思维方式不同。
because human beings do not think the way economists think we think.

42
00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:56.270
事实上，我们中没有人以我们认为我们思考的方式思考。
In fact, none of us think the way we think we think.

43
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.913
而且你越研究Kahneman
And the more you study Kahneman,

44
00:02:57.913 --> 00:03:00.860
更令人惊讶的是，我们曾经做过任何事情。
the more amazing it is that we ever get anything done at all.

45
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.861
所以Kahneman有一个比喻
So Kahneman has a metaphor for

46
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.634
人类思想建立在两个系统相互作用的基础上。
human thought based on the interaction of two systems.

47
00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:08.289
系统二和系统一。
System two and system one.

48
00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:14.310
系统二，我们可以把它想象成头部，是更高层次的系统。
System two, which we can think of as the head is the higher level one.

49
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.120
这是分析性的。
It's analytic.

50
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.110
这是算法。
It's algorithmic.

51
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.420
这是我们做数学，推理和逻辑的地方。
It's where we do mathematics and reasoning, and logic.

52
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.389
这是一台非常精密的机器。
It's a really sophisticated machine.

53
00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.031
它需要大量的努力才能使用，而且速度非常慢。
It requires a tremendous amount of effort to use and it is very slow.

54
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.259
所以，我们尽可能让它关闭。
So, we leave it turned off as much as possible.

55
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.524
这是因为这个系统太慢了，我们不得不发明计算机，
It's because that system is so slow that we had to invent computers,

56
00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:40.376
因为系统二不能产生社会的所有数字
because system two is not capable of generating all of the numbers that society

57
00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:43.639
为了做到这一点，需要社会进化。
needed in order to do it social evolution.

58
00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.146
所以我们需要想出一些机器来进行这种处理
So we needed to come up with machines to do that processing for

59
00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:49.014
我们，然后是系统一。
us, then there's system one.

60
00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:51.699
系统一，你可以认为是你的直觉。
System one, you can think of as your gut.

61
00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:52.900
这是直觉。
It is intuitive.

62
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.099
这是启发式的。
It's heuristic.

63
00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.819
这是联想。
It's associative.

64
00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.829
非常快。
It is very, very fast.

65
00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:57.500
这不需要努力。
It requires no effort.

66
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.110
事实上，你无法关闭它。
And in fact, you cannot turn it off.

67
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.590
它一直在运行，我们有这两个系统的想法并不是新的。
It's on all the time and the idea that we have these two systems is not new.

68
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.585
我的意思是，我们都有这种直觉，我们有这两个系统
I mean, we all have this intuitive sense that we've got these two systems and

69
00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:10.379
有时你甚至能听到他们。
sometimes you can even hear them.

70
00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.853
有时如果你对重要的事情感到困惑，你可以听到你的
Sometimes if you're confused about something important, you can hear your

71
00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:16.910
头脑告诉你一件事，你的直觉告诉你其他事情。
head telling you one thing and your gut telling you something else.

72
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.134
我们都经历过。
We've all experienced that.

73
00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:22.627
Kahneman发现的是这两个系统是如何连接的。
What Kahneman found was how the two systems are connected.

74
00:04:22.627 --> 00:04:27.019
它发现系统2得到了它的假设，它的赠与，
It turns up system two gets its assumptions, its givens,

75
00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:32.137
其工作集来自系统一，且不知道该连接。
its working set from system one and is not aware of that connection.

76
00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:36.470
系统二认为它是从深层真理的宝库中得到的东西，但是
System two thinks it's getting the stuff from the vault of deep truth, but

77
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.170
不是。
it's not.

78
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.262
它是从一号系统和一号系统得到的，
It's getting it from system one and system one,

79
00:04:40.262 --> 00:04:44.572
因为它是一个近似的系统，有时会出错。
because it's an approximate system sometimes gets things wrong.

80
00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:47.865
如果你有一个带有错误输入的逻辑系统，
And if you have a logical system with false inputs,

81
00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:52.009
你可能会得到错误的输出，结果证明我们一直在这样做。
you can get false outputs and it turns out we do this all the time.

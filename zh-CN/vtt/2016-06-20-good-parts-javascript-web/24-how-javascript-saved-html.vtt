00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.331
&gt；&gt；Douglas：HTML在20世纪末推出时还不是最先进的
&gt;&gt; Douglas: HTML was not state of the art when it was introduced in the late 20th

3
00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:07.849
世纪。
century.

4
00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.099
它的目的是为简单的文档查看器，而不是打算
It was intended for simple document viewers it was not intended to be

5
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.910
应用程序交付平台。
an application delivery platform.

6
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.379
我们坚持使用它作为应用程序交付平台，因为我们需要一个
We insisted on using it as an application delivery platform because we needed one

7
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:22.219
这是最好的东西，所以我们用了它。
and that was the best thing available, so we used it.

8
00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.515
但它并不是很适合我们想要做的事情。
But it was not well suited to what we wanted to do.

9
00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:26.702
一开始很多人看着它
A lot of people looked at it in the beginning and

10
00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:29.699
认为它不具备所需的能力，他们是对的。
thought it didn't have what it takes, and they were right.

11
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.170
但我们还是继续做了。
But we went ahead and did it anyway.

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.100
因此，从那时起，Web标准就从一个天真的超文本系统发展而来
So since then, the web standards were grown from a naive hypertext system

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.210
在强烈的高度不稳定的竞争压力下。
under intense highly unstable competitive pressure.

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.109
当网景和微软试图通过操纵网络来摧毁对方时
As Netscape and Microsoft attempted to destroy each other by manipulating web

15
00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.880
标准，它并不是为做所有这些Ajax东西而设计的。
standards and it wasn't designed to do all of this Ajax stuff.

16
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.792
它的成功归功于许多非常聪明的人，他们找到了制造它的方法
Its success is due to a lot of very clever people who found ways to make it

17
00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.558
尽管其设计限制，但仍能工作。
work despite its design limitations.

18
00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:02.729
HTML是对SGML的巨大改进。
HTML was a huge improvement over SGML.

19
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.319
主要是因为它在任何时候都会简单得多
Primarily in that it was much a simpler anytime you take something that's

20
00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:08.140
太复杂和
too complex and

21
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.189
把它变成简单的东西，得到一般都在使它变得更好。
turn into something it's simple, get generally are making it better.

22
00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.480
不幸的是，它们也使其更具弹性。
Unfortunately, they also made it more resilient.

23
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.659
SGML中的规则之一是如果您当时不认识标签
One of the rules in SGML was if you don't recognize the tag then

24
00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.299
彻底失败，什么都没发生，他们认为这对网络来说太多了。
total failure, nothing happens and they thought that was too much for the web.

25
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.120
所以在网络上，规则是如果你看到一个标签
So instead on the web, the rule is if you see a tag and

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.200
您不认识它，忽略它并继续解析它，它就会工作。
you don't recognize it, ignore it and keep parsing and it works.

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.479
这实际上对网络有好处，因为这意味着我们可以升级。
And that's actually been good for the web because it meant that we could upgrade.

28
00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.000
我们可以具有向前和向后兼容性，因为浏览器将
We could have forward and backward compatibility because the browsers would

29
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.240
当他们进入和离开标准时忽略差异。
be ignoring the differences as they enter and leave the standards.

30
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.579
不幸的是，黑暗的一面是曾经，也许现在仍然存在，
Unfortunately the dark side of that is that there were, maybe still are,

31
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.599
不能正确编写HTML的不称职的Web管理员。
incompetent web masters who could not correctly write HTML.

32
00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.519
而且浏览器会做一些英雄般的事情来尝试有意义
And the browsers would do heroic stuff to try to make sense

33
00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.430
他们正在写的东西。
out of the stuff that they are writing.

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.930
这变成了安全漏洞，我们将在第三天讨论。
Which turned into security exploits which we'll talk about on the third day.

35
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.889
所以HTML的原始形式
So the original formation of HTML

36
00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.378
作者实际上无法控制演示文稿。
authors had virtually no control over presentation.

37
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.650
而且这件事并没有预料到除了简单的文档之外的应用程序
And the thing didn't anticipate applications beyond simple document

38
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.536
检索，这是我们现在所做的非常小的一部分。
retrieval, which is a very small part of what we're doing now.

39
00:02:22.536 --> 00:02:27.189
它不是内部自洽的。
It's not internally self-consistent.

40
00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.659
例如，它提供了两种编写大纲的方法
For example, it provides two ways of writing outlines

41
00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.168
一个是嵌套的，一个不是，它是不一致的。
one is nested one is not, it's not consistent.

42
00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.460
我们称之为网页的东西不是网页，而是一个卷轴。
And the thing that we call a web page is not a page, it's a scroll.

43
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.329
我希望有一天我们能发明页面，因为页面很棒。
I'm hoping someday we invent pages, cuz pages are great.

44
00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.219
页面是文明前进的一大步，
Pages were a big step forward in the march of civilization,

45
00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.240
也许有一天网络会赶上这一点。
maybe someday the web will catch up to that.

46
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.159
所以SGML社区讨厌HTML，他们认为它是可憎的。
So the SGML community hated HTML, they thought it was an abomination.

47
00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.090
他们不喜欢它被简化的方式
They did not like the way it was simplified and

48
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.650
更重要的是，他们不喜欢它比SGML更受欢迎的方式。
even more than that they did not like the way it was so much more popular than SGML.

49
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.259
所以最终他们接管了W3C
So eventually they took over W3C and

50
00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.629
开始改变事物使之更符合他们的喜好。
started changing things to be more to their liking.

51
00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.990
例如，他们改变了p的工作方式，p原本是一个分隔符，
For example, they changed the way p worked, p had originally been a separator,

52
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.270
他们把它变成了一个容器。
they turned it into a container.

53
00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.550
他们开始了关于语义标记的事情
They started the thing about semantic markup which

54
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.310
结果证明是一种巨大的时间浪费，他们还创建了XML Fiasco。
turned out to be a colossal waste of time and they also created the XML Fiasco.

55
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.439
他们的想法是创建XML，它将是SGML的继承者。
The idea was that they would create XML, which would be the successor of SGML.

56
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.300
它将被用作新的文档格式，以取代HTML和
Which would be used as the new document format replacing HTML and

57
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.074
作为世界上的数据交换格式，它在这两方面都失败了。
be used as the world's data interchange format, it failed at both of those things.

58
00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:43.752
事实证明HTML拒绝死亡
HTML it turned out refused to die and

59
00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:48.045
它仍然是Web的文档格式和
it is still the web's document format and

60
00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:52.213
世界上的数据交换格式是
the world's data interchange format is

61
00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:57.069
杰森。&gt；&gt；扬声器2：但是你说
Jason. &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But you said

62
00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.419
你可以谈论神话语义学。道格拉斯：不，我不是
you can talk about mythical semantics. &gt;&gt; Douglas: Not, I am not

63
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.530
来谈论语义标记。&gt；&gt；扬声器2：好的。
to be talking about semantic markup. &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

64
00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:05.780
&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：你得找个人
&gt;&gt; Douglas: You'll have to find someone

65
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.748
否则我就不会告诉你了。&gt；&gt；扬声器2：不，
else to tell about that. &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No,

66
00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:10.520
我很好奇为什么你。&GT；&GT；道格拉斯：它没有得到回报，
I'm curious as to why you. &gt;&gt; Douglas: It didn't pay off,

67
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.687
我们花了很多时间在上面
we spent a lot of time on it and

68
00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:17.742
没有得到任何东西。&GT；&GT；扬声器2：你知道，
didn't get anything for it. &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You know,

69
00:04:17.742 --> 00:04:22.956
我们遇到的唯一像这样的人是有残疾的人
the only folks that we run into that like it are people who have disabilities

70
00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:28.007
谁想要语义标记提供一些额外的信息
who want the semantic markup to provide some extra bit of information for

71
00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:29.535
他们。道格拉斯：我非常同情
them. &gt;&gt; Douglas: I have a lot of sympathy for

72
00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.685
试图使用网络的残疾人，
people with disabilities who are trying to use the web,

73
00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:36.042
我不认为这是解决办法。&gt；&gt；道格拉斯：但是
I don't think that was the solution. &gt;&gt; Douglas: But

74
00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:40.596
我可以理解绝望的程度，与网络提供的东西相比
I can understand being desperate enough that compared to what the web delivers

75
00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:45.069
任何东西看起来都会比你得到的更好。
that anything else might look to be better than what you got.

76
00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.029
我可以谈论CSS，但我只是开始咆哮
I could talk about CSS, but I just start ranting and

77
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.819
你不需要听我咆哮，是吗？
you don't need to hear me rant, do you?

78
00:04:53.659 --> 00:05:00.620
不管怎么说，只是，所以
Anyways it's just, so

79
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.660
我的意思是，这是在和一个终于擅长CSS的人交谈
it's talking to someone who's finally gotten good at CSS I mean

80
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.870
很难提高到CSS是真的很难和困难。
it's hard to step up to CSS is really hard and difficult.

81
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.180
最终设计师到达那里
Eventually designers get there and

82
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.329
一旦他们这样做了，斯德哥尔摩的事情似乎就会发生在他们身上。
once they've done it this Stockholm thing seems to happen to them.

83
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.759
这有点像在警察身上看家庭纠纷。
And it's kind of like watching a domestic dispute on cops.

84
00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:31.608
CSS还不错，你只是不像我那样理解它，是的。
CSS isn't bad, you just don't understand it like I do, yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:05:31.608 --> 00:05:35.600
无论如何，如果网络上只有HTML和
Anyway if all there was to the web was HTML and

86
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.819
CSS，它现在应该已经被替换了。
CSS, it would have been replaced by now.

87
00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.199
网络将不复存在，我们将致力于其他的工作
The web would be gone and we would be working on something else and

88
00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.269
这就是证据。
this is the proof of that.

89
00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.159
Forrester Research的董事长兼首席执行官乔治·柯罗尼(George Colony)说，
George Colony, the Chairman and CEO of Forrester Research was saying,

90
00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.149
另一种软件技术将会出现
Another software technology will come along and

91
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.446
消灭网络，就像它杀死了新闻，Gopher等人一样。
kill off the Web, just as it killed News, Gopher, et al.

92
00:05:55.446 --> 00:05:59.850
在接下来的两三年里，审判日很快就会到来。
And that judgment day will arrive very soon, in the next two to three years.

93
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.670
所以他在2000年预测，到2003年，
So he was predicting in 2000, that by 2003,

94
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.790
网络将会死掉，取而代之的是他所说的X互联网，这
the web would be dead, replaced by what he called the X Internet, which

95
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.920
是一个可执行的互联网应用程序，它是一个应用程序交付系统。
was an app that the executable Internet, it was an application delivery system.

96
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.379
他认为万维网是有缺陷的，因为它所能做的
That he thought that the web was deficient because all it could do

97
00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:22.939
是分发文件，而这不是世界所需要的。
was dispense documents and that is not what the world needed.

98
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.475
此报价不再出现在Forrester网站上。
This quote is no longer on the Forrester website.

99
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:29.824
&gt；&gt；扬声器2：[笑]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

100
00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.709
&gt；&gt；Douglas：archive.org有它。
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Archive.org has it though.

101
00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:33.470
你可以去Archive.org，它就在那里。
You can go to archive.org, it's right there.

102
00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.610
所以很多人都听到了这个消息，
So a lot of people heard this message,

103
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.149
很多人都相信它，包括微软。
a lot of people believed it including Microsoft.

104
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.629
所以当网景自毁时，微软说很好。
So when Netscape self destructed, Microsoft said good.

105
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.980
我们一开始就不想要网络，所以他们解散了IE团队
We didn't want the web in the first place, so they disbanded the IE team and

106
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.670
让他们在X互联网上工作。
put them to work on the X Internet.

107
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.310
所以，他们启动了.net项目，
So, they started up the dot net project,

108
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.110
他们把人放在阿瓦隆上，他们在那些东西上取得了进展。
they put people on Avalon, they got moving on that stuff.

109
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.540
所以，令人惊讶的是网络并没有消亡，
So, the surprise was that the web didn't die,

110
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.899
它没有死的原因是因为JavaScript。
and the reason it didn't die was because of JavaScript.

111
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.230
殖民地所主张的
That what Colony was arguing for

112
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.790
正确的是，世界需要一个应用程序交付系统。
correctly was that the world needed an application delivery system.

113
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.660
他没有意识到的是网络
The thing he didn't recognize was that the web

114
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.129
已经是一个了，因为所有浏览器中都有JavaScript。
already was one because JavaScript was in all the browsers.

115
00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.879
现在Java社区，以不同的方式记住了这一点。
Now Java community, remembers this differently.

116
00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.920
Java社区对JavaScript非常生气，因为
The Java community is really angry at JavaScript for

117
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.199
在浏览器中并且认为这是完全不公平的
being in the browser and thinks it's completely unfair

118
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.230
JavaScript是浏览器中的语言。
that JavaScript was the language in the browser.

119
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.120
如果Java在浏览器中，事情就会有所不同，
Had Java been in the browser things would have been different,

120
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.230
但事实并非如此。
except that's not the way it was.

121
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.279
Java是浏览器中的第一种语言，Java小程序失败了。
Java was the first language in the browser and Java applets failed.

122
00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:46.970
Java小程序是软件史上最大的失败。
Java applets were the biggest failure in the history of software.

123
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.062
总在公众面前，巨大的规模，平躺在你的脸上，
A total out there in public, huge scale, flat on your face,

124
00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:53.533
我们在软件中看到的最大的失败是Java applets。
the biggest failure we've ever seen in software was Java applets.

125
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:57.141
他们应该写一次，到处跑，做所有的事情
They were supposed to write once and run everywhere and do everything and

126
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:58.750
他们没有，完全失败了。
they didn't, total failure.

127
00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:01.560
另一方面，
On the other hand,

128
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.360
浏览器仍然存在，因为JavaScript是用来保存它的。
the browser is still in existence because JavaScript was there to save it.

129
00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:13.980
所以很多使用JavaScript的人或者每个人都讨厌JavaScript。
So a lot of people who used or everybody hates JavaScript.

130
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:20.810
有些不了解JavaScript的人讨厌它，因为他们应该知道它。
There are people who don't know JavaScript who hate it because they should know it.

131
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.110
使用JavaScript并且讨厌它的人实际上讨厌DOM。
The people who do use JavaScript and hate it, actually hate the DOM.

132
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.639
DOM是浏览器呈现给JavaScript和
The DOM is the API that the browser presents to JavaScript and

133
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.899
这是有史以来发明的最糟糕的API之一。
it is one of the worst APIs ever invented.

134
00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:37.467
这真的很糟糕，它也是由Brendan Eich设计的，他在
It's just really awful, it was designed also by Brendan Eich, he designed at

135
00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:41.260
就在他设计JavaScript的同一周。&gt；&gt；扬声器2：[笑]忙碌的一周。
the same week that he designed JavaScript. &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Busy week.

136
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.301
道格拉斯：这是忙碌的一周，
&gt;&gt; Douglas: It was a busy week,

137
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:46.528
他被递给丹尼·古德曼的超级卡堆，这是一本书，也就是两本
he was handed Danny Goodman's HyperCard pile which is a book, that's two or

138
00:08:46.528 --> 00:08:48.950
HyperCard大约有三英寸厚。
three inches thick about HyperCard.

139
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.600
他从未使用过HyperCard，从未使用过脚本系统，非常聪明的家伙，
He never used HyperCard, never used a scripting system, very smart guy,

140
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.649
学习很快。
very quick study.

141
00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:58.830
他很快地读完了这本书，并认为他已经领会了它，
He read the book very quickly, and thought he got a sense of it,

142
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.809
如何将HyperCard模型应用于浏览器。
how do you apply the HyperCard model to the browser.

143
00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:09.621
他想出了DOM，这太可怕了，太可怕了。
And he came up with the DOM and it's just awful, it's just awful.

144
00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:13.669
多年来还有很多其他人对它进行了改进。
There have been many other people over the years who have improved it.

145
00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:17.470
例如，最重要的贡献之一是Scott Isaacs
For example one of the most important contributions was Scott Isaacs

146
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.830
微软的。
of Microsoft.

147
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.338
他在IE 14上
He was on the IE 14 and

148
00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:28.350
他看着网景公司提出的非常奇特的模型，
he looked at the very peculiar model that Netscape had came up with,

149
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.980
并以一种非常好的方式将其正常化。
and normalized it in a really good way.

150
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:35.759
在最初的Netscape模型中，并非所有元素都是可脚本的，并且
In the original Netscape model, not all elements were scriptable, and

151
00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:38.440
那些可编写脚本的内容只能在中编写脚本
those that were scriptable were only scriptable in

152
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.495
一种与HyperCard书中的内容相匹配的方式。
a way that matched what was in the HyperCard book.

153
00:09:40.495 --> 00:09:44.700
就像它说的，让我们让它们都以同样的方式工作
And as it said, let's make them all work the same way

154
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.940
这使得愚蠢的编程变得非常容易。
which made dumb programming significantly easier.

155
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.029
但他们从未完成的原因是因为
But they never finished the reason they never finished was because

156
00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:53.570
弗雷斯特说已经结束了。
Forrester said it's done.

157
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.590
所以这没问题，他们都被放在其他项目上，在IE6之后，
So this is okay and they were all put on other projects and after IE6,

158
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.399
它只是离开了，我对这个故事很感兴趣。
it was just left and I was into the story.

159
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:06.679
所以他们知道它还没有完成，他们从来没有打算把它留在那种状态，
So they knew it wasn't finished they never intended to leave it at that state,

160
00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:09.600
就是这么做的。
it's just what was done.

161
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.639
所以他们经常做其他事情，结果是不完整的API
So they would often did other things, as a result it's incomplete API

162
00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:17.740
这是在错误的抽象级别，使用起来太可怕了。
that's at the wrong level of abstraction that's just horrible to use.

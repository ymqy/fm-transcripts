00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:06.533
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：现在看来我有一点经验
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Now it turns out I have a little bit of experience at

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.507
说服世界上的每个人去做正确的事情。
convincing everybody in the world to do the right thing.

4
00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:12.266
&gt；&gt；观众：[laugh]&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：例如，
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: For example,

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.611
有JSON数据交换格式，
there's the JSON data interchange format,

6
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.269
世界上最受欢迎的数据交换格式。
the world's best loved data interchange format.

7
00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.987
花了一段时间说服每个人，但最终每个人都同意了，而且
It took a while to convince everybody but eventually everybody got on board, and

8
00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:26.539
死亡威胁停止了，我们现在都很高兴。
the death threat stopped and we're all happy about it now.

9
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.010
我很高兴地报告，这花费了不到一代人的时间。
I'm very happy to report that this took much less than a generation.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.649
这是一种非常罕见的东西，我们可以在几分钟内移动它
This is one of those very rare things where we're able to move it in just a few

11
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.173
好几年了。
years.

12
00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:41.265
因此，如果您查看Google Trends并比较JSON与XML的趋势，
So, if you look at Google Trends and compare the trends of JSON versus XML,

13
00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:46.890
您将看到世界一直在对XML失去兴趣。
you'll see that the world has steadily been losing interest in XML.

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.060
看起来年份在这里被砍掉了，但它在另一个屏幕上。
Looks like that the years are chopped off here but it's on the other screen.

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.170
自2005年以来，世界一直对XML失去兴趣。
Since 2005 the world has steadily been losing interest in XML.

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.850
我们一直在慢慢地、悄悄地看到人们对JSON的兴趣在悄悄上升。
And we've slowly, quietly been seeing interest in JSON creeping up.

17
00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.289
而这种增长并不是由任何行业推动的。
And this increase was not motivated by any industry.

18
00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.362
没有JSON行业推动这一点，
There is no JSON industry which drives this there,

19
00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:15.935
因为所有的工具都是免费和简单的，所以它之所以发生是因为
because all the tools are free and simple and so it's just happening because

20
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:20.456
你认为这是一种更好的做事方式，所以它只是采取了。
you decided this is a better way of doing things and so it's just taking up.

21
00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:25.795
所以我不能预测这些线何时相交，但谷歌可以，所以看起来是下一个
So I can't predict when these lines cross over but Google can, so looks like next

22
00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:31.540
当然，根据Google的说法，JSON在官方上比XML更有趣。
year for sure JSON becomes officially more interesting according to Google than XML.

23
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.625
&gt；&gt；Speaker 2：但是就使用JSON的用户而言，
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But in terms of use people who were using JSON,

24
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:41.810
作为数据交换，有更多的人使用JSON，对吗？
as a data interchange there's more people using JSON, right?

25
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.120
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：我没有办法知道。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I have no way of knowing.

26
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.334
在我看来也是这样，但是-&gt；&gt；扬声器2：我认为他们只是
It seems like that to me too but- &gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think they're just

27
00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:48.625
谷歌XML，因为它仍然是困难的，我们不必谷歌一个JSON，所以
Googling XML because it's still difficult and we don't have to Google a JSON so

28
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:49.689
经常是因为这很容易。
often cuz it's easy.

29
00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.879
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：我认为那里有很多东西，是的，所以很多。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I think there's a lot to it there, yeah, so a lot of.

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.240
如果搜索建议，XML烂透了
If the search suggestions, XML sucks,

31
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.969
这是一件很流行的事情，你在JSON搜索中看不到这一点。
that's a popular thing, you don't see that on JSON searches.

32
00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.308
因此，很可能会有这样的事情发生。
So there may very well be something to that.

33
00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:15.427
因此，我并不打算让JSON成为最后一种数据交换格式。
So I did not intend for JSON to be the last data interchange format.

34
00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:19.663
JSON旨在做一件非常具体的事情，允许用
JSON was intended to do a very specific thing of allowing applications written in

35
00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:23.150
不同的语言能够通过
different languages to be able to communicate with each other over

36
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.974
互联网。
the Internet.

37
00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:26.733
但是JSON现在被用于很多其他事情，
But JSON is now being used for lots of other things,

38
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.683
它并不一定是为它设计的，所以
things that it wasn't necessarily designed for and so

39
00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:32.939
我预计它们也将是其他数据格式。
I expect they're going to be other data formats as well.

40
00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.020
因此，我对任何可能正在设计另一种数据格式的人都有一些建议。
So, I have some advice to anybody else who might be designing another data format.

41
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.979
第一，请不要破坏JSON。
Number one, please don't break JSON.

42
00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:46.253
JSON在它最初设计的目标上工作得非常好。
JSON is working really well for the thing that it was originally designed for.

43
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:51.800
我在JSON中做的最好的事情之一是，我没有在它上面放一个版本号。
One of the best things that I did in JSON was, I did not put a version number on it.

44
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.770
所以没有办法修改它。
So there is no way to revise it.

45
00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.599
我们不能说JSON 1.1，因为没有JSON 1，它只是JSON。
We can't say JSON 1.1 because there was no JSON 1, it's just JSON.

46
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.740
所以它的方式，就是它永远的方式，
So the way it is, is the way it will always be,

47
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.270
这很好，因为如果你看一下堆栈。
which is great because if you look at the stack.

48
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.058
我预计随着时间的推移，每一层的堆叠都会不断变化，
I expect over the years the stack is gonna be changing all the time at every level,

49
00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:15.615
除了JSON层。
except in the JSON layer.

50
00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:19.157
JSON层将始终以现在的方式工作。
The JSON layer will always work the way it does right now.

51
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:23.856
这是一件非常好的事情，有那么高的可靠性，
And that's a pretty nice thing, having that level of reliability,

52
00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:27.500
网络的完整性和任何东西都是巨大的。
the integrity and anything in the net is huge.

53
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.289
我想不出我们可以向JSON添加的任何功能比这更有价值。
I can't think of any feature we could add to JSON which is more valuable than that.

54
00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.250
所以，如果你想做点别的，请做点别的
So, if you want to make something else, please make something else and

55
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.176
让它变得更好。
make it better.

56
00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:40.219
但不要试图破坏JSON，不要管JSON。
But don't try to break JSON, leave JSON alone.

57
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:43.813
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：无论你要做什么，
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Whatever you're gonna do,

58
00:03:43.813 --> 00:03:46.665
如果你要做一些类似于JSON但又不同的事情，
if you're gonna do something that's kind of like JSON but different,

59
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:48.579
让它变得更好。
make it significantly better.

60
00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.129
如果只是JSON有一两个小东西，那么你所做的就是
If it's just JSON with one or two little things, then what you're doing is you're

61
00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.740
给这个世界增加了兼容性风险，人们会
adding a compatibility hazard to the world, that people are gonna

62
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.800
必须处理类似于JSON但不是JSON的事情。
have to deal with this thing which is kind of like JSON but isn't.

63
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370
所以这是要付出代价的。
And so there's a cost to that.

64
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.681
因此，确保成本是值得的，增加足够的价值，以证明该成本。
So make sure the cost is worth it, add enough value to it to justify that cost.

65
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:16.457
并获得一个更好的名称，因为毫无疑问，JSON最糟糕的地方就是名称。
And get a better name because no question, the worst thing about JSON is the name.

66
00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:20.095
首先，人们对如何发音感到困惑。
For one thing people are confused about how to pronounce it.

67
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:23.028
我说JSON，很多人都说JSON，
I say JSON, a lot of people say JSON,

68
00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:26.925
原来正确的发音是JSON。
it turns out the correct pronunciation is JSON.

69
00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:29.540
&gt；&gt；观众：[笑]&gt；&gt；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：大家？
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Everybody?

70
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.596
&gt；&gt；观众：JSON。
&gt;&gt; Audience: JSON.

71
00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:36.036
&gt；&gt；Douglas Crockford：[笑]是的，所以我一直听到一些叫Jason的家伙的来信
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: [LAUGH] Yeah, so and I hear from guys all the time named Jason

72
00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:41.834
说，我在办公室，我听到有人说，什么。
saying, I'm in the office and I hear someone saying, what.

73
00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.341
所以，如果你在这里，我很抱歉杰森。
So, I'm sorry Jason if you're here.

74
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:47.173
我不知道我在想什么，对不起。
I don't know what I was thinking, sorry.

75
00:04:47.173 --> 00:04:52.187
所以我听说有个叫杰森的家伙威胁说
So I've heard from guys named Jason that threaten to make

76
00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:58.300
新的标准叫做道格拉斯，所以只是为了向我展示它是什么样的。
new standards called Douglas, so just to show me what it's like.

77
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.769
但是，JSON最糟糕的地方还是名称。
But again, the worst thing about JSON is the name.

78
00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:07.199
它代表JavaScript Object Notation，几乎所有关于它的东西都是错误的。
It stood for JavaScript Object Notation and almost everything about that is wrong.

79
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.120
所以我把它命名为JavaScript，因为我想表扬它
So I called it JavaScript because I wanted to give credit

80
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.980
到JavaScript，因为这就是这个想法的来源。
to JavaScript because that is where the idea came from.

81
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.553
JSON不是我发明的，我已经在这种语言中发现了它
I didn't invent JSON, I discovered it already in this language and

82
00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:20.889
我只是想尊重它。
I was trying to give respect to it.

83
00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.014
我并不是想跳到JavaScript的大衣尾巴上，因为我会在2001年告诉你，
I was not trying to jump on JavaScript's coat-tail because I'll tell you in 2001,

84
00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:28.970
JavaScript不是一种非常受欢迎的语言，对吗？
JavaScript was not a much loved language, right?

85
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.100
说到这里，我是JavaScript，这不是一种从任何人那里获得信任的方式。
In saying, I'm JavaScript, that's not a way to get credibility from anybody.

86
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.100
我只是试着诚实，我只是试着认清它是从哪里来的。
I was just trying to be honest, I was just trying to recognize where it came from.

87
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.939
但是这个名字是有问题的，首先人们还不知道Java是什么
But the name is problematic, for one thing people still don't know what Java is

88
00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.909
与JavaScript相比，这方面的工作仍在进行中。
versus JavaScript, and that stuff is still going on.

89
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.668
而且还有一个混淆，所以JSON只能与JavaScript一起工作，
And also there is a confusion that, so JSON only works with JavaScript,

90
00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:57.637
不，那不是真的，从来都不是真的。
no, that's not true, that was never true.

91
00:05:57.637 --> 00:06:02.523
还有一个令人困惑的地方，我猜JavaScript语言标准是
There is also a confusion that I guess the JavaScript language standard is

92
00:06:02.523 --> 00:06:05.375
JSON的定义从来都不是真的。
what defines JSON and that was never true.

93
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:09.083
但所有这些困惑都是因为我选择了错误的名字。
But there are all these confusions that happened because I chose the wrong name.

94
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:10.415
&gt；&gt；演讲者2：你应该怎么称呼它？
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What should you have called It?

95
00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:12.754
&GT；&GT；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：我不知道。
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I don't know.

96
00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:14.560
&gt；&gt；观众：[听不到]&gt；&gt；道格拉斯·克罗克福德：那艘船有
&gt;&gt; Audience: [INAUDIBLE] &gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: That boat has

97
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.389
帆船，我们完事了。
sailed, we're done.

98
00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.759
然后是物体，
Then there is object,

99
00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.350
这里的Object表示JavaScript正确看待对象的方式，
object here represents the way that JavaScript thinks about objects right,

100
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.389
只是键值对的松散集合，这是一个对象。
just a loose collection of key value pairs, that's an object.

101
00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.220
这不是大多数语言考虑对象的方式，对吗？
Which is not the way most languages think about objects, right?

102
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.909
他们有更脆弱的东西，我们有类和实例，等等。
They have this more brittle thing, we've got classes and instances, and so on.

103
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.230
所以他们会感到困惑，我们可以向他们发送JSON对象和
So they get confused that we can send them a JSON object and

104
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.564
他们去那不是一个物体，是的。
they go that's not an object, yeah.

105
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.766
符号，也许没问题。
Notation, maybe that's okay.

106
00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.560
所以记法是不好的。
So notation is bad.

107
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.920
所以如果你要制定一个新的数据标准
So if you're going to make up a new data standard and

108
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.029
我认为你应该，不要叫它JSON。
I think you should, don't call it JSON.

109
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:52.389
不要在它前面贴一封信，或者
Don't stick a letter in front of it or

110
00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.189
一封信或其他类似的东西。
a letter on the end of it or anything like that.

111
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.909
想出一些创意，在那里做点好事。
Come up with some creativity, do something good there.

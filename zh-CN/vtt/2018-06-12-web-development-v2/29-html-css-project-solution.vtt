00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go ahead and
start styling these.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.770
Let's start by styling a story.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.660
So if we come back over here and look
at our mockup here, the whole thing has

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.020
these kind of black bars on the top and
black bars on the bottom.

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.225
Let's kinda start with kinda
the borders looking here.

6
00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:24.805
So I'm gonna say, border:,

7
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:32.992
how did I do it inside of here?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I did it with just, okay.

8
00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:37.690
So, a story has a border of 1px solid.

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.080
We'll say, you can say black.

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.446
Black is like the blackest
black that it can do.

11
00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:47.571
A really nice black,
that I quite like is, #333.

12
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:50.773
It's a nice,
like a little bit softer black.

13
00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:53.530
So, that's what I tend to use.

14
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.605
So you can see here,
these now have a black border on them.

15
00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:00.110
Typically you don't want text
pushed up right against the side.

16
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.005
It looks a little mushed together, so

17
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.590
just a nice little bit of padding
gives a little bit of breathing room.

18
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.550
So if you give it 5 px,
or something like that,

19
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.440
it just pushes things away from the sides,
and makes it look a little nicer.

20
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.694
Okay, I'm gonna do something with the row

21
00:01:15.694 --> 00:01:19.841
here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm

22
00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:24.310
gonna make this display: flex; right?

23
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.581
It makes sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

24
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.131
I'm gonna do align-items, and

25
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:37.595
I wanted everything to be the same height,
right?

26
00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:41.143
That's something that we
can kinda see over here.

27
00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:44.458
Everything's the same height even though,
this is not actually taking up this,

28
00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.400
there's a lot of white space down here,
that's okay.

29
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.509
So we're gonna do a line items: stretch,
and

30
00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.356
now if we come back over here,
hit Refresh,

31
00:01:57.356 --> 00:02:02.476
now it's kind of starting
to take some shape.

32
00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.670
Kind of fix these titles a little bit.

33
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.556
So come up here and do .story-title.

34
00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:15.990
We're going to make this font weight:
normal, I made it italic in there as well.

35
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.578
So this is going to be text-style,

36
00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:25.874
no font-style: italic.

37
00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:31.655
Let's do font-size: 30 px, and
give a bit of margin on both sides.

38
00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:37.576
So I'm gonna say margin: 15px 0; and

39
00:02:37.576 --> 00:02:40.453
then text-align:

40
00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:46.874
center.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

41
00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:49.390
starting to look a little bit
more like what we have over here.

42
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.241
Yeah, looking better.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another pro tip is,

43
00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:03.253
if you have dense text like this,
this is kinda hard to read for people.

44
00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:07.544
So we can give it maybe a little more,
we're gonna go under here and

45
00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:12.603
do .story-text, there's a thing called
line-height, which is how space

46
00:03:12.603 --> 00:03:17.531
to put between things, like how things
can be double-spaced or whatever.

47
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:22.323
Usually, at least for dense texts like
that, you want it to be at least 1.2,

48
00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:24.622
which is like 1.2 normal spacing.

49
00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:25.480
It's a multiplier.

50
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.020
You can think of that as
being like a multiplier.

51
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.510
I'll give it 1.5, just so
it looks a little bit more spaced out.

52
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.833
Now, it breathes a little more,

53
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:39.628
it's a little bit easier to see.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool?

54
00:03:44.528 --> 00:03:46.684
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that looks pretty good.

55
00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:50.514
We want this to be a little bit more,
not quite so,

56
00:03:50.514 --> 00:03:56.640
we wanted this one to be bigger in the
middle rather than the one's on the sides.

57
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.990
Right now it's split into thirds, and

58
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.820
we would like it to be
split more into 25-50-25.

59
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.190
A couple ways we could do that.

60
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.974
The easiest way is to set
the .quarter to be 25% width.

61
00:04:11.974 --> 00:04:15.807
Whoops, width: 25%.

62
00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:18.455
Now, if we come back over here.

63
00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:19.577
That looks terrible.

64
00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:26.112
[LAUGH] Not at all what
I was intending to do.

65
00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:33.478
And then have the half be width: 50%.

66
00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:39.980
Yeah, that looks like
a little bit more spaced out.

67
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.279
Another way you could do this is you
could use what's called Flexgrill.

68
00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.240
Let me look at Flexbox.

69
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.711
This one I have to look up,
cuz I can't always remember.

70
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:52.604
So there's order, flex-grow.

71
00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:54.125
Yep, that's what I thought.

72
00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:59.006
So, instead of doing width: 25%; you
could do a, say, flex-grow, and for

73
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:03.956
quarter you want it to be one unit, and
then you want this one to be flex-grow: 2,

74
00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:08.340
cuz you want this to be two units,
right, so you're gonna have one unit,

75
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.830
two units, one unit.

76
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.590
That basically means that this half
is going to be double the quarter is.

77
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.364
So now we can get rid of these widths.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe not.

78
00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:42.592
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Flex-basis,

79
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.232
maybe that's what it is.

80
00:05:44.232 --> 00:05:47.730
Anyway, you can get a little
bit more clever with it.

81
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.400
The thing with Flexbox is it's gonna

82
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.234
make sure everything has a proper
width to take as much as it wants.

83
00:05:54.234 --> 00:05:56.940
For now we'll just stick with widths
25% cuz I think that's a little

84
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.665
bit easier to deal with.

85
00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:03.566
Let's get this image
centered really quick.

86
00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:09.430
So, a couple ways you could do this.

87
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.800
The easiest way I think is gonna be,
I think we could just say,

88
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.730
what did we say, it was .story-image,
is that what we call that?

89
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.290
I don't think we gave it a class, did we?

90
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.640
We didn't.

91
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.680
So, this image here we're
gonna say story-image.

92
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.804
Save that, and then refer to .story-image,
and let's just make it take up 100%

93
00:06:30.804 --> 00:06:35.757
of its space,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

94
00:06:35.757 --> 00:06:37.480
that way now it gets a little bit bigger.

95
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.612
It's gonna stretch the image a little bit,
but also puppies, so

96
00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:46.470
I'm okay with it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good?

97
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.492
How do we feel about this?

98
00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:52.280
You can see it's a really
iterative process.

99
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.240
You just kind of like do something.

100
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.140
It's like, how does that look?

101
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.700
And then you do something, and
then say, okay, now how does it look?

102
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.497
And a lot of times I'll just do this
directly in the dev tools as well.

103
00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:03.299
Yeah, this .story-text is a little small.

104
00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:04.570
Let's make that a little
bit bigger as well.

105
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.351
Maybe font-size: 16px,
or something like that.

106
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:12.402
That's exactly what it is.

107
00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:13.185
Good job Brian.

108
00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:22.310
Let's try 18.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, there we go.

109
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.920
That looks a bit better.

110
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.788
Okay, how do we feel about the middle row?

111
00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:28.650
Did that go okay?

112
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.578
Do you kind of understand
how we worked it out here?

113
00:07:30.578 --> 00:07:32.083
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

114
00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:32.875
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

115
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:36.574
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go do the bottom row.

116
00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:39.951
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go look at our

117
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:43.895
picture, our design, and
we're gonna have another story here, so

118
00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:48.472
we can pretty much just use this styling
that we have up here on this one, right?

119
00:07:48.472 --> 00:07:53.695
So we're gonna have here another row,

120
00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:57.670
section.row, and

121
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.670
the first thing that we're gonna have
is another one of these stories.

122
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.280
I'm just gonna, again, copy and paste it,

123
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.660
cuz I'm not super
interested in rewriting it.

124
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:14.210
But yeah, say I have another story there,
come back here and look at our picture.

125
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:22.232
And now we another image right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

126
00:08:22.232 --> 00:08:29.241
and then the next thing we're gonna have
is, we're gonna have another article,

127
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:34.230
or actually,
this looks more like a navigation, right?

128
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.220
Because it looks like how you would
navigate to the rest of the site, so

129
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.620
there's actually one called nav,
so I'm gonna call this site-nav.

130
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.072
Right, and there's an element called nav,
and that's really useful because

131
00:08:47.072 --> 00:08:52.068
assistive technologies like screen readers
can say, okay, this is a navigation.

132
00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:56.020
I know that all the navigating links
are in there, so it's also helpful for

133
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.600
accessibility technology.

134
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.953
And it's just useful to you
in the future to know, okay,

135
00:09:01.953 --> 00:09:07.480
this is where I stuck all my navigation.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

136
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.477
cool, so what would you call these, right?

137
00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:14.970
I don't really know what I would call it,
it's kind of a list, actually.

138
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.303
So I might call this an unordered list
cuz it doesn't actually matter what order

139
00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:20.151
these come in.

140
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:21.486
So I'm gonna call it an unordered list,

141
00:09:21.486 --> 00:09:27.217
I'm gonna call this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: nav-list, in fact,

142
00:09:27.217 --> 00:09:33.027
I might, yeah, whatever, this is fine.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's

143
00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:36.681
actually even make this, let's do it this
way, we're gonna get rid of the nav.

144
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:39.291
And we're just gonna make
this an unordered list, and

145
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:43.873
I think that's okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

146
00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:48.604
I'm gonna do an li, and
then this is gonna be a nav item, and

147
00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:53.553
I'm gonna have five of those.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

148
00:09:53.553 --> 00:09:59.890
what did I have, I had sports,
I had politics, I had local,

149
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:06.081
I had technology, a good one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

150
00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:09.700
opinion, maybe, I don't know,
it doesn't really matter.

151
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.800
Okay, so
now I have these five list items on there.

152
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.820
Come back over here, there you see them.

153
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.285
And we're gonna make this
a three-quarter as well,

154
00:10:21.285 --> 00:10:27.626
three-quarter.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

155
00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:33.487
so now we have here underneath this,
this is gonna be a three-quarter,

156
00:10:33.487 --> 00:10:39.981
and this takes up 75%.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come back over here,

157
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:43.430
look, yeah, looks more or
less like it's doing that.

158
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.319
Okay, and now we're gonna
come inside of the nav-list.

159
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.383
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And inside of here,

160
00:10:52.383 --> 00:10:55.787
we're gonna have another display flex,

161
00:10:55.787 --> 00:11:00.762
right, cuz this is going to be
flex in the column direction.

162
00:11:00.762 --> 00:11:03.618
Right, so let's do that.

163
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.496
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So display: flex,

164
00:11:12.496 --> 00:11:17.762
it's gonna be flex-direction:

165
00:11:17.762 --> 00:11:22.841
column.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

166
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:29.120
then each one of these is going to be
a nav-item, right, is what we called it.

167
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.953
These are gonna be width 100%,
see what that looks like so

168
00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:40.588
far.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

169
00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:43.727
let's see, inspect element.

170
00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:53.885
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, those are all taking

171
00:11:53.885 --> 00:12:00.375
100%.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what we wanna do,

172
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:04.298
is we want each one of these to take up as
much space as it possibly can, right, so

173
00:12:04.298 --> 00:12:09.536
that's gonna be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What did I do here,

174
00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:14.724
I can't even remember.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inspect,

175
00:12:14.724 --> 00:12:18.060
I remember the way I got this,
I really liked it.

176
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.911
Line item center and
flex 1, that's what it is.

177
00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:27.829
So there's a thing here that you
can say to basically take up as

178
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:32.006
much space as you possibly can,
which is flex: 1.

179
00:12:32.006 --> 00:12:35.186
Let me make sure that's actually
what I'm going for, yeah.

180
00:12:35.186 --> 00:12:38.010
So let's talk about what flex: 1 is for
just a second.

181
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.000
As you can see here, I still have to
refer back to stuff I've done before.

182
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.680
I have to look at this page
literally twice a day.

183
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.327
So what I did here is, I used flex,
which is a combination of flex-grow,

184
00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:55.903
flex-shrink, and flex-basis,
which is what I was not doing before.

185
00:12:55.903 --> 00:12:57.949
I needed to combine flex-grow and
flex-shrink.

186
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:04.500
And if you do flex 1, it basically says,
take up as much space as you can.

187
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.380
And in fact, if I went up here and
I made these flex 1, flex 2 and flex 3,

188
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.070
then that's what I was going for before.

189
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.904
So in any case, does that kind of
make sense that if you say flex 1,

190
00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:20.260
it's just basically,
each one of these is one item, and

191
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.820
I want you to take up as
much space as possible.

192
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.460
And each one of these is gonna take up
20% because if there's five of them.

193
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.100
But if I deleted one of them,
they would take up 25%,

194
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.810
it kind of just automatically does
that adjusting for you, cool?

195
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.990
Okay, so
that's what flex 1's gonna do here for us.

196
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.658
We wanted to color them each
kind of different colors.

197
00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.971
So what we can do here is,

198
00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:56.476
we can say nav-item:nth-child(1),
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

199
00:13:56.476 --> 00:14:02.777
we can say background-color, I'm gonna
copy these colors because I could not come

200
00:14:02.777 --> 00:14:12.260
up with these colors on my own.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

201
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.730
and we're gonna have five of these.

202
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:21.160
So I'm just gonna do nthchild 3, 4, 5.

203
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.494
You could go through and
give each one of these their own class and

204
00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:25.801
style that on the class.

205
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.698
But this is a lot easier because
then if we change things around,

206
00:14:28.698 --> 00:14:30.430
we don't have to change the classes.

207
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.858
And I can just go and

208
00:14:32.858 --> 00:14:37.622
copy all these colors.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops.

209
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.722
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about this so

210
00:14:42.722 --> 00:14:44.898
far while I'm copying and pasting colors?

211
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:11.507
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

212
00:15:11.507 --> 00:15:16.708
if we come back over here to
Frontend Masters, now notice they all

213
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:22.733
have nice colors, right.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is annoying,

214
00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:27.660
we have this annoying padding here,
which is what we added ourselves.

215
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.950
So we kinda have to go back and
override that.

216
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.194
So what we're gonna do
here with the nav-list,

217
00:15:34.194 --> 00:15:37.402
we're gonna say have margin: 0 and

218
00:15:37.402 --> 00:15:43.661
padding: 0.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Refresh that,

219
00:15:43.661 --> 00:15:47.819
that looks a little bit better,
okay, this still has bullets,

220
00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:51.827
right, cuz it's getting that
from the unordered list part.

221
00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:53.860
And in this particular case,
we don't want it to have bullets.

222
00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:00.367
So you can just come in here and
say, nav-list, list-style: none.

223
00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:02.670
Come back over here,
that should drop that.

224
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.255
And now, we would like all these
things to be centered inside of them.

225
00:16:06.255 --> 00:16:11.205
This will be another really easy
case that we can just come here and

226
00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:12.830
say, display flex.

227
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:21.547
And we're gonna have it
do align-items center.

228
00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:24.163
And hope we won't mess up
with justified context.

229
00:16:24.163 --> 00:16:26.910
We still want it to be
sort of left justified.

230
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:31.088
So that's gonna centre
it vertically in here.

231
00:16:31.088 --> 00:16:38.760
We're gonna give it a bit of a padding on
the left to kinda get a little indented.

232
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.711
So we're gonna say padding left,

233
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:47.094
maybe 25 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Get that nice and

234
00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:52.337
inside, and then we'll get another
font size in that to be more like a 30

235
00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:57.399
pixels.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks a little

236
00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:02.875
bit more like what we're going for, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

237
00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:07.946
think I made the font color a little nice,
a little kinda gray,

238
00:17:07.946 --> 00:17:14.666
let's go maybe a CCC, something like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry,

239
00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:22.119
not font color just color.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No a bit darker than that,

240
00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:27.171
let's go with maybe 999, 666.

241
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:30.656
That's not lucky but looks nice though.

242
00:17:30.656 --> 00:17:35.731
[LAUGH] Someone's going to be upset.

243
00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:39.043
We're going to do 555, okay.

244
00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:41.684
Underneath that,
then we're gonna do a font-weight:

245
00:17:41.684 --> 00:17:47.778
bold
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You could change

246
00:17:47.778 --> 00:17:53.808
the font family, as well to more like
an Arial or something like that.

247
00:17:53.808 --> 00:17:59.470
That's another nice thing that
the visual studio code will do for you.

248
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.783
Notice here,
it actually has this font stack.

249
00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:05.200
It's like, hey, here's a good
group of fonts to group together.

250
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.950
So I just hit Enter.

251
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.000
Cuz if the computer has Arial,
it will use Arial.

252
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.971
If it doesn't have Arial,
it'll use Helvetica.

253
00:18:10.971 --> 00:18:13.456
And if it doesn't have Helvetica,
it'll say,

254
00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:15.648
just give me something that's San Serif.

255
00:18:15.648 --> 00:18:17.533
Which, I do not wanna get into typography.

256
00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:20.326
Also, you don't wanna listen
about typography from me.

257
00:18:20.326 --> 00:18:25.110
But sans-serif is just something that
doesn't have like caps on the letters

258
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.518
basically or serifs.

259
00:18:26.518 --> 00:18:27.920
I guess this way has their technical.

260
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.410
So that's kinda nice, right?

261
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.100
I mean there is links originally.

262
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.917
So, I guess a power should go through and

263
00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.776
meet these links
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

264
00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:44.557
I'm gonna show another cool trick that
you can do with Visual Studio Code.

265
00:18:48.881 --> 00:18:49.744
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a command,

266
00:18:49.744 --> 00:18:54.619
no.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I hold Alt, so

267
00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:57.813
I'm holding my Alt key and
I click it multiple times.

268
00:18:57.813 --> 00:19:00.680
I can have multiple cursors going at once.

269
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.439
And then I can just start
typing all of them at once.

270
00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:06.585
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To just make this go

271
00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:11.540
nowhere.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

272
00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.492
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cut that and then,

273
00:19:16.492 --> 00:19:21.173
I wanna go to the next after that and
paste that.

274
00:19:21.173 --> 00:19:25.087
And then, I was able to do all of
those all at once, pretty cool, right?

275
00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:28.393
[LAUGH] Rather than having it type and
re-type it five different times,

276
00:19:28.393 --> 00:19:30.000
or copy and paste a bunch of times.

277
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.766
Again, you just hold Alt and
then you'll just click multiple times, so

278
00:19:34.766 --> 00:19:37.135
if I just click holding
Alt here you'll know so

279
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:43.062
I just get a bunch of different cursors
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I can

280
00:19:43.062 --> 00:19:48.139
type in all of them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

281
00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:51.689
anyway.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sublime does that as well.

282
00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:53.842
So that's not a unique thing to code.

283
00:19:53.842 --> 00:19:58.001
Actually, I would say at this point,
most editors will do that.

284
00:19:58.001 --> 00:20:02.453
Okay, so now these are a different
color because links have a default

285
00:20:02.453 --> 00:20:07.144
color.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we come back over here

286
00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:14.578
and we're gonna say.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nav-link a.

287
00:20:14.578 --> 00:20:19.410
So we wanna style every linker
tag inside of nav-links.

288
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:25.102
We're gonna say
text-decoration: none; color.

289
00:20:25.102 --> 00:20:27.074
We'll move this color
that we have down here.

290
00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:37.402
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry, nav-item rather.

291
00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:41.354
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now,

292
00:20:41.354 --> 00:20:44.870
these will link, you can hover
over them it'll change the cursor.

293
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:50.109
If you remember, if you look at this one
you'll notice that if you hover over it,

294
00:20:50.109 --> 00:20:51.584
it'll underline it.

295
00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:55.646
Easy way to do that is to do navlink.

296
00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:59.820
Or rather nav

297
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.136
item a:hover.

298
00:21:05.136 --> 00:21:08.317
And then I say, text-decoration:

299
00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:14.412
underline.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

300
00:21:14.412 --> 00:21:16.362
for now, if I come back over here,
refresh.

301
00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:18.715
If I hover over it,
it underlines it just to let you know,

302
00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:20.190
this is definitely a link.

303
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.764
It's just a good kinda thing to do for
your users.

304
00:21:23.764 --> 00:21:26.027
If they hover it and
then see something change about it,

305
00:21:26.027 --> 00:21:31.146
they know that it's interactive thing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.

306
00:21:31.146 --> 00:21:33.088
&gt;&gt; Student2: How's the area right now,

307
00:21:33.088 --> 00:21:36.690
that it's underlining
everything all the time.

308
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:41.287
And I tested on just one like sports for
example and

309
00:21:41.287 --> 00:21:46.011
I then, I send it the hover
just like you showed us.

310
00:21:46.011 --> 00:21:48.767
Do you know why possibly it could be?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

311
00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:52.685
the first thing you need to do is
you need to remove it, right here.

312
00:21:52.685 --> 00:21:58.619
Do text-decoration: none first because
links by default have an underline,

313
00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:02.970
so you have to explicitly say,
please remove this first.

314
00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.824
And it has to be specifically
on the inker tag, your class,

315
00:22:06.824 --> 00:22:09.129
you have to be styling
specifically the inker link.

316
00:22:09.129 --> 00:22:14.300
You can't be styling the li, right?

317
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.913
So going here, I can't style this and
say text-decoration: none,

318
00:22:18.913 --> 00:22:24.242
I have to actually be styling the inker
tag, that's another common thing to do.

319
00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:24.830
Does that help?

320
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:31.635
Okay, so pretty close here.

321
00:22:31.635 --> 00:22:36.496
Actually, I mean let's more less it.

322
00:22:36.496 --> 00:22:38.840
Let's try this just for fun.

323
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:45.202
To make sure that I'm not crazy,
flex: 1; flex: 2; and

324
00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:50.118
flex 3.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

325
00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:51.860
that more or less arrives at the same.

326
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.256
If you do flex 1, flex 2, and flex 3.

327
00:22:55.256 --> 00:22:59.484
Any questions, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Student: [INAUDIBLE] be to one then,

328
00:22:59.484 --> 00:23:01.873
practice to use margin,

329
00:23:01.873 --> 00:23:06.566
where's padding to move contents around?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a great

330
00:23:06.566 --> 00:23:12.022
question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When

331
00:23:12.022 --> 00:23:15.339
should you use margins and
when should you use padding?

332
00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:18.625
There are definitely cases where
it's just a total toss up and

333
00:23:18.625 --> 00:23:20.550
it doesn't really matter.

334
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.701
In those cases, I tend to lean,
actually, I don't even really know.

335
00:23:23.701 --> 00:23:26.684
I would say, I'd lean towards margins but
I don't even know if that's necessarily

336
00:23:26.684 --> 00:23:31.443
true.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I guess kinda

337
00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:35.438
the rule of thumb is margins are for
spacing things between each other, right?

338
00:23:35.438 --> 00:23:38.437
So if I was trying to add
space between this section and

339
00:23:38.437 --> 00:23:41.820
this section over here,
they're two separate elements.

340
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.224
And so if put margins between them, it
would be like a no man's land that really

341
00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:48.985
nothing would own,
either one of those things.

342
00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:51.200
In that case, you definitely wanna
use a margin between the two.

343
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.884
Whereas, I'll use padding more if it's
included inside of that element tray,

344
00:23:56.884 --> 00:24:01.322
so inside of these links here whether I
can create space inside of the elements,

345
00:24:01.322 --> 00:24:03.396
that's when you wanna use padding.

346
00:24:03.396 --> 00:24:06.703
So you have to ask yourself,
am I just spacing things out or

347
00:24:06.703 --> 00:24:09.620
am I actually spacing
things inside of something?

348
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.941
Is that sufficiently big?

349
00:24:12.941 --> 00:24:17.485
[LAUGH] That's the best I got for you.

350
00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:22.289
This is one of those things that you kinda
look at it and you just kinda know and

351
00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:25.986
I think that kind of knowing
just comes from doing it a lot.

352
00:24:25.986 --> 00:24:27.325
It's a really crappy answer.

353
00:24:27.325 --> 00:24:31.354
[LAUGH] It's what I got though.

354
00:24:31.354 --> 00:24:35.200
Yeah, please.
&gt;&gt; Student3: I had a quick question.

355
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.562
When you're doing the Sports, Politics,
Local, how did you get the text to line up

356
00:24:39.562 --> 00:24:42.490
within each of those
individual little color boxes?

357
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:43.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How did I get them to

358
00:24:43.258 --> 00:24:44.689
center?
&gt;&gt; Student3: Yeah.

359
00:24:44.689 --> 00:24:45.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I used Flex

360
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.688
again.
&gt;&gt; Student3: Okay.

361
00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:48.338
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this Flex within Flex

362
00:24:48.338 --> 00:24:49.640
within Flex.

363
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.446
I'm not joking.

364
00:24:50.446 --> 00:24:53.639
It's literally within three times,
so let's look at that.

365
00:24:53.639 --> 00:24:56.390
That's a really good question, though.

366
00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:01.262
Right nav, I don't, so

367
00:25:01.262 --> 00:25:04.974
reason flex: 1.

368
00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:09.350
Flex: 1 actually interacts with the nav
list, which this is display flex.

369
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:13.497
Then itself is doing display
flex on the things inside of it.

370
00:25:13.497 --> 00:25:16.329
And that you're doing that
with the a line item center,

371
00:25:16.329 --> 00:25:19.832
that's actually what's gonna get
us to center or the middle there.

372
00:25:19.832 --> 00:25:20.940
Make sense?

373
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.722
Cool, I don't expect you to totally
arrived here by yourself by the way,

374
00:25:24.722 --> 00:25:27.360
this is actually quite a difficult plot.

375
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.314
If I had given this to you
without flex first of all,

376
00:25:30.314 --> 00:25:32.808
this would have been totally impossible.

377
00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:36.230
This would have been advanced,
pay someone a lot of money to do this.

378
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.060
Flex makes this possible that I can teach
this to you on the first day that you're

379
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.212
learning HTML and CSS.

380
00:25:41.212 --> 00:25:46.227
But if you got most of the way there
by yourself, you should feel pretty

381
00:25:46.227 --> 00:25:51.682
damn good about that, because this is not,
this is pretty industry stuff.

382
00:25:51.682 --> 00:25:54.859
These are things that you would
find yourself doing at a job.

383
00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:55.530
Which is pretty cool.

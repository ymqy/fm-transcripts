00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.020
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: I wanna
create a table of contents.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.725
So I want to be able to see
what else is in the docs.

3
00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:10.300
And to do that,
as kind of a shortcut today,

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.450
we will just create a component
that does that for us.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.632
So the way that that works is,
we're going to get into our components.

6
00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:26.679
And let's just create something
called table-of-contents.js.

7
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.987
And inside of that we'll just
start out with some style so

8
00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:34.360
that we don't have to do that in phases.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.918
So we'll set the pragma to jsx,
we'll import jsx from theme-ui.

10
00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:43.608
And then we're also going
to import graphql, Link so

11
00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:46.077
that we can link between the pages.

12
00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:51.958
And then a hook that Gatsby
gives us called useStaticQuery.

13
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:57.360
Now because this is not a template,
we don't have access

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.920
to the page queries or context or
variables or anything.

15
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.540
So we're gonna use this useStaticQuery so
that we can get data out.

16
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.687
But it's important to note that you can
only do this if you don't need variables.

17
00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:17.120
You have to hard code
everything in a useStaticQuery.

18
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.870
That's why it's static.

19
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.660
You don't get dynamic content.

20
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.430
So first,
let's set up our component itself,

21
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.200
TableOfContents, if I could spell it.

22
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.866
That doesn’t get any arguments and
we will export that as our default.

23
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.665
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Inside we will,
as a first step, load our data.

24
00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:46.360
So let’s get the data and that’s gonna
be the result of useStaticQuery.

25
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.040
And we use the graphql tag to
signify that it is indeed a query.

26
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.210
And I wanna get allDocsPage nodes and

27
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.730
I want the id, so
that we can use it as a react key.

28
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.479
I want the title, so
that we can have some display text.

29
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.599
And I want the path, so that we know where
to send somebody if they click the link.

30
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:12.534
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Once we’ve got
that data, it’s gonna come in and

31
00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:14.227
be stored in this data prop.

32
00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:16.160
Gatsby will do this at build time,
actually.

33
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.860
So we don’t need to await it or anything.

34
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.670
It just as far as the component is
concerned when it runs on the browser,

35
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.779
that data will already exist.

36
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.127
Then we can, for convenience,
let's rename pages and

37
00:02:32.127 --> 00:02:37.021
we'll get data.allDocsPage.nodes.

38
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.300
And then we can return a thing.

39
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.860
So the thing that we wanna return is,
we'll give it a div in case we

40
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.438
want to style it or add some borders or
something around it.

41
00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:51.430
We're not gonna do that for now, but
we want to leave that door open.

42
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.960
Let's add a heading to it.

43
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.230
So we'll say Explore the Docs.

44
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.940
And then we'll just show these in a list.

45
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.170
So let's map over our pages.

46
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.805
And for each one we're gonna get
out that id, path and title.

47
00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:14.400
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And
we can return an li.

48
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.740
We'll set the key to the id.

49
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.340
And then inside of that,
we're gonna use a link.

50
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.550
And I want that to link to the path and
I wanna give it some styles.

51
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.570
So the styles that I want are actually
gonna be one it's active.

52
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.680
So what that means is,
when we're reviewing the current page,

53
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.070
I wanna show a slightly different style so
we know what page we're on.

54
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.766
So we'll do that in just a second.

55
00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:44.230
And then we want that
to link to the title.

56
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650
So this is what will be displayed.

57
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.731
And then whenever this
is the active class,

58
00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.404
Gatsby has this really handy helper.

59
00:03:52.404 --> 00:03:56.888
That will let us just set whenever
the current link is the one that's being

60
00:03:56.888 --> 00:03:57.910
visited.

61
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.278
It'll just set a class name for us.

62
00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:00.175
So I'm gonna set that to active.

63
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:06.155
So now we're getting into some theme
UI stuff that's a little different.

64
00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:08.165
We're wanting conditional styles.

65
00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:12.505
We want this component to only have
a style when we're using a class on it,

66
00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:14.115
when it has that active class.

67
00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:19.770
So to do that, we can use a pretty
standard CSS and JS technique.

68
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.160
Which is to use the ampersand which
references the current element.

69
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.420
And then we modify it with the active
class by adding this .active here.

70
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.440
Inside of that we can apply
whatever styles we want.

71
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.106
So let's say we want our
font style to be italic.

72
00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:41.830
We'll say that we want the text decoration
to be none because it's the current link.

73
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.630
We want to de-emphasize it as a link but
not actually deactivate it as a link.

74
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.280
And then I want to go one step further and

75
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.480
I actually want to tell people that
this is the page they're viewing.

76
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.720
So I'm gonna use the after pseudo class.

77
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.460
And again we just add it as a string and
then add a subobject here.

78
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.080
And I'm gonna set the content.

79
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.347
And this is worth noting
the content in CSS and

80
00:05:06.347 --> 00:05:10.623
JS ends up looking like
it's double quoted.

81
00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:17.100
Because you have to quote it once to
make it a property for JavaScript.

82
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.297
And then you have to quote it for CSS.

83
00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:22.244
Which means that we've got
single quotes for JavaScript and

84
00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:24.830
then we've got double quotes for CSS.

85
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.308
So, I'm gonna set this as
the currently viewing.

86
00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:34.240
And so, these ones are for
JavaScript, these ones are for CSS.

87
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.919
That's a gotcha, that definitely got me.

88
00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.060
So it's worth just kind of like
trying to pin that in your head for.

89
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.720
When you are trying to
use this in the future.

90
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.250
So now that we've got this,
we should be able to just use it.

91
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.780
So let's go into our docs page.

92
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.080
And I'm just gonna toss it in.

93
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.190
Let's see how it goes.

94
00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:04.500
So let's import TableOfContents
from table-of-contents.

95
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.729
And we can drop that right at the bottom.

96
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.553
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Gotta
start the site first,

97
00:06:13.553 --> 00:06:18.415
yarn workspace theme-dev develop.

98
00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:27.320
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: Reload, and
there we go, we're currently viewing.

99
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.940
So let's add an extra page to make sure
that it's working the way we expect.

100
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.650
So we're going to theme-dev, under docs,
and I'm gonna create a new file and

101
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.360
we'll call it another.mdx.

102
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:47.764
So we'll give it a title, let's call it
another page, and we'll say More docs!

103
00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:52.292
&gt;&gt; Jason Lengstorf: And there we go.

104
00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:55.709
So now we can click around to our pages.

105
00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.041
And see that we've got
other pages in there.

106
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:01.060
They are showing up the way we expect.

107
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.750
The theme is hot reloading,
we created that file.

108
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.930
We didn't have to stop and restart it.

109
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.771
Just picked it right up.

110
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:10.000
And our table of contents is
doing what we wanted to do.

111
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.630
So there is a good place to save our work.

112
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.490
So let's git add all.

113
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.330
Take a look at what we've done, okay?

114
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.966
So we updated the docs page
to use our table of contents.

115
00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:26.100
Wrote that table of contents component.

116
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.460
And created a new docs page.

117
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.340
So we'll commit that.

118
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.341
Say add table of contents, push that up.

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have 22 sections here,
it seems like a lot, and

2
00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:05.922
that's because it kind of is.

3
00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.840
[LAUGH] But we'll get through this, and

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.360
yeah we'll go ahead and
get into the introduction of the course.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.240
So I'm really, really excited about this
of all the courses that I've taught,

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.450
this is the one I've definitely
put the most time into.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.120
And this is a particularly
difficult subject to teach,

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.720
just because I've been doing programming
for a really, really long time and

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.660
so I have forgotten what it's
like to learn how to write code.

10
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.468
So I have all these layers of
knowledge in my head and it's hard for

11
00:00:38.468 --> 00:00:39.722
me to pull them back.

12
00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:40.776
To say like, okay,

13
00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:45.135
how can I speak to someone that doesn't
have the same vocabulary that I do, right?

14
00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:48.580
Something that I spent years and
years taking for granted.

15
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.060
So your responsibility today, both online
and in person is to keep me honest.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.491
So if I'm using terminology
that you don't understand or

17
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:59.764
acronyms that you don't understand,
it's not that I'm trying to be a jerk,

18
00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:01.816
it's not that I'm trying
to inflate my own ego.

19
00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:04.005
My ego is plenty big, believe me,

20
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:08.613
[LAUGH] it's because it's really
difficult to pull back those layers and

21
00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:13.420
realize that what I'm saying is
not vocabulary that you have.

22
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.487
So, if you're online tell the moderate
that you don't understand something,

23
00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:24.831
if you're in person just raise your hand.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That being said,

24
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:27.491
I worked really, really hard to try and

25
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:32.180
put this on common terms terminology,
so hopefully that works out.

26
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.151
Okay, so there are some tips
here to succeed in this course,

27
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:42.430
you don't have to be a wizard
at math to write coding.

28
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.570
In fact the two subjects,
in my opinion, are quite orthogonal.

29
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.396
In the sense they're not, you can be great
at math and terrible at programming and

30
00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:51.907
you can be great at programming and
terrible at math.

31
00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:54.296
I'm definitely the latter
of those two things,

32
00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:57.858
I don't know if I'm great at programming
but I'm not very good at math.

33
00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:01.895
And so that's a lot of times when people
are approaching coding that's one of

34
00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:05.308
the first things that I hear is
that I wasn't very good at math, or

35
00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:07.629
they kind of try to
relate this back to math.

36
00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:10.443
And like there are mathematical
things in programming,

37
00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:13.613
like if you're gonna do like data
science and things like that.

38
00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:17.452
But that's not necessarily, you're not
going to be doing calculus, right,

39
00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:20.332
I don't think I've ever done
calculus with programming.

40
00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:24.827
So, that's something that you
should use yourself like right now,

41
00:02:24.827 --> 00:02:29.490
especially what we're doing today
doesn't have a lot to do with math.

42
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.330
Like I say here,
in fact I see many artist, lawyers,

43
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.350
linguists that actually have
great success writing code.

44
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.260
So, yeah just know that you can definitely
do this, this is open to everyone.

45
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.575
In fact I will say this is
actually more similar to learning

46
00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:53.110
a foreign language than
it is to learning math.

47
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.315
In the sense you learn a new way of
expressing yourself, that you have an idea

48
00:02:57.315 --> 00:03:01.270
in your head, and you want to express
that idea, basically, as code.

49
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.100
It's the same thing when you're learning a
language, you have this amorphous idea of

50
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.200
what you wanna say to the person, and
you have to use grammar to express that.

51
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.782
I would say that's probably
the closer analogy.

52
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:14.838
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that being said,

53
00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:17.450
what you're gonna do today is hard.

54
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.110
[LAUGH] I'm sorry that there's
no two ways about it, but

55
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.770
learning how to code
is not a simple thing.

56
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.160
It's actually quite difficult,
and so I guarantee you,

57
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.840
while you're going through and
learning some of these things,

58
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.880
they're just gonna like come up to you
like this is hard, I don't get this.

59
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.460
And then you start kinda going to these
files like I should this where I can see

60
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.700
what this other person's doing, and
they get it and I don't get it yet.

61
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.312
Don't go there, like it's not
a useful place to be in your brains.

62
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:48.924
Don't compare yourself to other people,
don't feel like you should be getting

63
00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:51.830
things like, you either do get it or
you don't get it.

64
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.196
And both of those things are okay,
right, there's no right way to do this,

65
00:03:56.196 --> 00:03:59.353
there's no correct speed
that you should be going at.

66
00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:04.335
So just learn on your own pace, learn in
your own terms, and sometimes you have to

67
00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:09.118
recognize like my brain is exhausted at
this moment in time and I need to stop.

68
00:04:09.118 --> 00:04:13.388
Take a break, go for a walk, all that
kind of stuff, before coming back.

69
00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:18.344
So just recognize your own feelings,
and like how you're doing, and

70
00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:21.377
kind of take stock of that as we're going.

71
00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:26.438
And just take it easy,
I think that's kinda what I'm trying

72
00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:31.479
to say here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is this sounds really

73
00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.349
important right here, never feel afraid
to google anything and everything.

74
00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.565
I think I kinda got this feeling from
school where I felt like I was googling

75
00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:43.615
something it means I was cheating.

76
00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.597
But just google everything
it's not cheating,

77
00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:48.784
in fact it actually a requirement.

78
00:04:48.784 --> 00:04:52.116
Part of what you're learning today
is how to google things, in fact,

79
00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:54.208
that's kinda what it
is to be a programmer.

80
00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:58.582
Is that we're just giving you additional
vocabulary of how to google things,

81
00:04:58.582 --> 00:05:00.777
you are a professional Googler today.

82
00:05:00.777 --> 00:05:06.328
So, please, please like any time you don't
remember something, if you don't remember

83
00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:11.384
the order something goes in, all that
kinda stuff, just Google it, right away.

84
00:05:11.384 --> 00:05:17.057
So it's not cheating, it's a skill.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Don't be afraid to copy and

85
00:05:17.057 --> 00:05:20.697
paste code, I see a lot of people
online saying like don't copy and

86
00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:23.242
paste this, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

87
00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:26.300
Just copy and paste it,
make your stuff work and

88
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.666
then work backwards to see how it works,
right, that's fine too.

89
00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:35.121
Like I program by StackOverflow
all the time [LAUGH],

90
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:37.762
again that's a skill as well.

91
00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:41.539
So definitely do that,
if you're not familiar with StackOverflow,

92
00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.187
that's a website where you can go and
ask programming questions and

93
00:05:45.187 --> 00:05:47.180
people will answer them for you.

94
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.818
It's old enough at this point that most of
the questions that you're going to have

95
00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:53.360
plenty of other people have
had these questions before.

96
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.108
So if you just search for it on
StackOverflow, it'll probably come up.

97
00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.842
So, that's a great resource,

98
00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:04.096
you should definitely be checking out
StackOverflow as we go through things.

99
00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.600
Be sure to ask dumb questions,
if it's not today, to someone else.

100
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.400
You can always reach out to me on Twitter,
my direct messages are always open.

101
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.632
So please ask lots of questions
to anyone that can answer

102
00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:19.876
them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And [COUGH] for

103
00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:24.270
me personally,
I can be a bit of a slow learner.

104
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.199
And so for me, it's repeatedly
exposing myself to information.

105
00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.283
And like the third or fourth time
that I see it or I Google it or

106
00:06:31.283 --> 00:06:35.440
find it on StackOverflow, that's
when it finally sinks into my brain.

107
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.358
So, if you're like me then just continue
to expose yourself to that information,

108
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:43.309
and maybe hopefully someday,
it'll sink in, or

109
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.823
you'll just get really good at
Googling that one web page,

110
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:52.140
so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

111
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.255
what's really difficult about learning to
code is specifically with web development.

112
00:06:57.255 --> 00:07:01.169
Is you have to learn a lot of things
all at once, in order for a kinda,

113
00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.612
get like a basic layer and

114
00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:06.492
it's really tough because you have
to kind of ignore some things.

115
00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.195
Like, we're just gonna throw
a bunch of stuff at you and

116
00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.496
parts of it you're just
gonna have to ignore and

117
00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:15.602
just realize that you're gonna come back
later and more deeply understand things.

118
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:19.971
I get this with some students that they
wanna understand that every piece as it

119
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.621
goes together and there's some parts that
are just not worth learning right now.

120
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:27.539
And that's really tough for
some people to say like ignore that, and

121
00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:30.622
they're like no I don't wanna ignore it,
I wanna learn that right now.

122
00:07:30.622 --> 00:07:34.119
And you'd have to recognize
that your brain only has so

123
00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:37.850
much capacity for
shoving stuff in it all at once.

124
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.852
And so if you start shoving like minor
details you're kind of like precluding

125
00:07:41.852 --> 00:07:45.377
yourself from right now learning
actually more important things.

126
00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:49.691
And again I would compare this to learning
a foreign language, because in order to

127
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:53.692
like actually have a full conversation
with someone in a foreign language,

128
00:07:53.692 --> 00:07:56.960
you have to understand actually
quite a bit of stuff, right?

129
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.300
You have to understand like grammatical
structures and syntaxes and

130
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.358
conjugations and agreements and
those kinda things.

131
00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:06.535
And it's kinda the same with programming,
you have to understand this whole set of

132
00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:09.112
things before you can kind
of put pieces together.

133
00:08:09.112 --> 00:08:11.825
So definitely what I'm not
trying to do to you today is,

134
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.384
have you ever seen that picture,
how to draw an owl?

135
00:08:14.384 --> 00:08:19.844
[LAUGH] It's like draw a circle, and
then step two is draw the rest of the owl.

136
00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:22.580
[LAUGH] I'm trying not
to do that to you today.

137
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.340
So hopefully what I'm gonna
present you with is like,

138
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.710
here's a mostly complete arrow,
and like now just draw the eyes.

139
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.823
Like I want to like
learn things like that,

140
00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:34.638
you kinda have to accept like I drew most
of the eye for you in the first place and

141
00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:37.760
eventually you will learn
how to like do that later.

142
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.740
So, that's kinda the methodology for

143
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.063
today.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

144
00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:47.209
lastly this is not a get
rich quick scheme, and

145
00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:51.404
I get that quite a bit as well
from people learning how to code,

146
00:08:51.404 --> 00:08:56.431
is they wanna get like a Google
job making $500,000 a year today.

147
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:59.263
And I was like,
this is actually a lot of work, and

148
00:08:59.263 --> 00:09:03.242
despite the fact that it doesn't
require you going to a university for

149
00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.641
four years and getting a certificate and
that kinda stuff.

150
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:09.818
It's still a turn of work it
requires a lot of investments,

151
00:09:09.818 --> 00:09:13.757
so like be prepared to work hard,
like this is not something that's gonna

152
00:09:13.757 --> 00:09:17.497
make you rich overnight so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That

153
00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:21.442
too.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And entry level jobs

154
00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:26.058
are out there, but you're gonna have
to compete and work hard for them.

155
00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:31.117
So, it's possible,
you should definitely try,

156
00:09:31.117 --> 00:09:37.275
I think but it is hard, so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The last

157
00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:40.945
thing I wanna say is just kind of
how I structured this course, and

158
00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:46.200
this is coming from a lot of iterations
from teaching a lot of these workshops.

159
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.380
This used to be more structured towards
like exercises, like almost like homework

160
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.325
and homework that just paints
as I said cuz I hate homework.

161
00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:58.149
[LAUGH] I was not very good at
homework when I was in college.

162
00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:01.779
So, I found that when I gave these
exercises to people a lot of times they

163
00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:05.046
would just like look at it and
say, I don't know where to start,

164
00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:06.641
I don't know where to do this.

165
00:10:06.641 --> 00:10:10.136
And it actually just bore like a lot of
frustration out of people rather than

166
00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:12.533
actually people like sitting there and
learning.

167
00:10:12.533 --> 00:10:17.171
So this workshop is more oriented
towards experimentation and playing, so

168
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:21.813
rather than having like a clear objective
I present you with a bunch of code.

169
00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:25.747
And then I was like okay, now just
mess around with it and break it and

170
00:10:25.747 --> 00:10:29.130
unbreak it and, try doing this and
you know refreshing and

171
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.991
like all these kind of different things,
and then we have a couple of big projects.

172
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.701
And that's kinda where you'll actually
like get in and like actually write things

173
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:41.225
by yourself but during the course, in
fact we'll get to that in just a second.

174
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:45.497
There's actually live code inside of
this website that you can just play with

175
00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:48.658
directly which should be
hopefully beneficial for you.

176
00:10:48.658 --> 00:10:50.534
This is how I think I
would prefer to learn so

177
00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:52.680
I'm hoping that this would work for
you as well.

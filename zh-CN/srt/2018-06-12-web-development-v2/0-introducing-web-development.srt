00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:05.253
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Awesome,
I'm really, really,

2
00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:07.670
really excited to be here with all of you.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.460
For people attending online, and
people that are watching it later, and for

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.927
people here in the audience.

5
00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:15.486
First of all let's go ahead and

6
00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:21.402
get everyone to go to this link
right here bit.ly/intro-web-dev.

7
00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:24.976
It is important that everything is
lowercase, so make sure you do that.

8
00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:28.392
This is just gonna take you to,
I'm gonna leave that up for a second, but

9
00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:31.192
it's gonna take you to the website
that you can see up behind

10
00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:35.749
it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So while I'm doing that,

11
00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.954
while I'm letting you type that in and get
to the website, just as kind of a sign,

12
00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:45.701
I'm really excited that this is a free
workshop and this is something that

13
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:50.012
we are extending to people so
that they can learn web development.

14
00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:54.600
And I'm really grateful for
Frontend Masters for sponsoring that.

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.287
If I have any wish for you for
how much effort I have put into this, for

16
00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:01.718
how much effort Frontend Masters
have put into this, it's for

17
00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:04.067
you to do something nice for someone else.

18
00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:09.998
That's just kind of my request for you is
that we've done something really nice for

19
00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:15.861
you also for you to go find someone that
needs something and do something for them.

20
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:20.910
Okay, so that should take you to
this website, Intro To Web Dev V2,

21
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.019
with all these nice shades of
blue that I did not choose.

22
00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.957
But it looks nice, doesn't it?

23
00:01:25.957 --> 00:01:32.621
[LAUGH] So you can see here just to
kind of get the lay of the land.

24
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:37.372
This is a website here it's on GitHub,
so that means all this is open source.

25
00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:40.995
All of these materials will be
open source free and forever.

26
00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:42.852
So you can take this home afterwards,

27
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.473
you can share this website
with anyone that wants it.

28
00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:46.974
These are literally my notes.

29
00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.872
That's why I have two laptops up here
is cuz I have actually right now it's

30
00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:54.006
open on both computers at once.

31
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:59.267
Just in case, I don't know,
it's like a safety blanket, I don't know.

32
00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:02.744
[LAUGH] So I can type in this one,
I can read my notes off this one.

33
00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:05.876
So anyway if you fall behind,
check the website cuz, again,

34
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:07.995
that's exactly what I'm reading from.

35
00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:12.471
Please share this around,
that's what this is here for.

36
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:16.832
If you see mistakes or grammar mistakes,
I'm sure there are many, many,

37
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:17.743
many of those.

38
00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:20.403
Please make a pull request on GitHub, and

39
00:02:20.403 --> 00:02:24.888
we will show you how to do that later
today, how to make pull requests.

40
00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:26.320
So, yeah.

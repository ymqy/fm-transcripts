1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: An img,
this is a self-closing tag, it's a or

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.510
a void tag,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it's an image.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.512
Right, it makes sense that you don't
have anything inside of an image,

4
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.030
an image is in and of itself enough.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.010
Its a one atomic unit that
cannot be broken apart.

6
00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:18.829
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

7
00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:21.601
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, we'll get into that

8
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:22.930
in just a second.

9
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.520
So, you give an image a source,

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.359
right, src.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.756
it'll looks something like this image
source = this will be some sort of

12
00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:37.170
URL pointing to a picture that's
being host something on the Internet.

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.100
And so, every image needs a source and

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.338
it also needs an alt, A-L-T.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Going back to

15
00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:49.020
screen readers, obviously,
if you're blind you can't see images.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.027
However, it can be really important
what's in those images for

17
00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:54.480
someone to understand your website, right?

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380
Like if you're having like,
this is an arrow pointing at something or

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.240
has other meaning to it so
you give it an alt.

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.000
So that when the screen reader
arrives to this particular image,

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.173
it has some texts to say about it, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if someone, let's

22
00:01:10.173 --> 00:01:15.676
actually just copy and paste this up here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come

23
00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:20.597
back up here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you have this little

24
00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:24.491
puppy picture that pops up.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

25
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:28.110
let's say this image broke, right?

26
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.900
It actually will show them the alt text,
like for whatever reason,

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.980
if that image got moved or
broken or something like that, so

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.460
it also doubles as like being
like a back up for it as well.

29
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.080
But also, if someone is using a screen
reader and they tap on to this and

30
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.800
it goes they obviously can't
see the picture it will say,

31
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.120
this is a picture of an adorable puppy,
right?

32
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.470
So, it's important to have
descriptive alt as well.

33
00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:54.639
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Every image tag should have

34
00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:01.650
an alt, 100% of the time always.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again,

35
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.571
that's being a responsible citizen that's
recognizing that the Internet is for

36
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:11.127
everyone.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

37
00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:17.579
what is a subtle difference that often
people have a hard time with when they're

38
00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.890
learning web development is you can
actually put images on a page with CSS.

39
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.920
So you don't have to use an img tag,

40
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.820
you can put it on there via CSS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The only

41
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.650
time that you wanna do this,
if it's purely decorative, right?

42
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.307
And that, if you have a background
image on your page, right,

43
00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:42.861
that's purely serves just like make
your page look nice, and it's purely for

44
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:48.470
aesthetic value, then that's when you're
gonna use CSS to put the image on there.

45
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.120
But if it's for something like
real content, right, like if maybe

46
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.280
we have an adoption website for puppies,
and we're putting that picture of

47
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.840
the puppy up there, that should be an img
tag because it needs an alt tag, right?

48
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.920
So the CSS version can't do alt text.

49
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.570
So that's why it's really important
that you need to use those img tags for

50
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.720
everything that's not decorative,

51
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.650
if it's purely decorative
then you can use CSS for it.

52
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.673
Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

53
00:03:21.957 --> 00:03:22.925
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The other thing that's

54
00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.190
useful is for search engines.

55
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.370
Search engines will also
read alt tags as well.

56
00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.298
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inputs,

57
00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:34.870
we were just talking about inputs.

58
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.240
So this is an input right here, it's
something that people can type into for

59
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.440
if you're filling out form, you wanna
put like first name and last name,

60
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.351
you would use an input tag for this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There are many

61
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.798
different flavors of input tags, if you
don't put anything it just assumes that

62
00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:52.498
you mean a text input which is
the most common one, I would say.

63
00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:59.328
But there is also a color picker, there's
a number input, there's a date input,

64
00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:05.440
there's a time input, file uploader,
there's a bunch of them.

65
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.187
More than I'm not thinking of as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

66
00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:12.659
I have right there numbers, dates,
colors, checkboxes, radio buttons, and

67
00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.819
just stuff like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll see more of that in

68
00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.133
the next page as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It looks like

69
00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:23.651
this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Textarea, so

70
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:28.090
what happens if you had to write an essay,
right?

71
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.150
You don't wanna write an essay in this,
that would be terribly annoying, right?

72
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.400
So it would be useful if you

73
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.255
could do something like this,

74
00:04:37.614 --> 00:04:43.069
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: textarea,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Text,

75
00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:46.929
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so

76
00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:49.664
I'm sure you've seen all
these websites right there.

77
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.880
They're like this big and
you can write a bunch a stuff in them and

78
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.590
you can hit enter as such,
that is a textarea.

79
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.090
So it's a larger input that it
combinates larger bodies of

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.910
text of them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now you something you might

81
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.790
point out to me in this point in time and
you'd absolutely right is like,

82
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.610
why is that not a self-closing tag, right?

83
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.646
Input are self- closing tags, so

84
00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:15.585
why aren't textareas?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is not a good reason,

85
00:05:15.585 --> 00:05:16.990
they just aren't.

86
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.760
They're old is the real reason.

87
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.760
Textareas have been around long enough

88
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.066
that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

89
00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:28.170
they were not made self-closing tags.

90
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.825
I think you can put, yeah, I mean,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you put something

91
00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:38.741
in here,
it'll like see the beginning value, right.

92
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:43.132
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can put things in

93
00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:45.633
there, that would be like the initial
value of whatever is in that

94
00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:49.329
text area.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't end up using text

95
00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:52.210
areas very often but it's good to
know about them, they do exist.

96
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.800
If you need like long
formed text from a user.

97
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:00.747
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inputs, text areas,

98
00:06:00.747 --> 00:06:03.506
select, select and options, specifically.

99
00:06:03.506 --> 00:06:07.798
So like a dropdown, right, like I'm
sure most of you have done like selected

100
00:06:07.798 --> 00:06:11.510
the state you're from and
click on it and you find many Minnesota.

101
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.280
And then you click on that, right,
that dropdown is a select, right?

102
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.790
And all the individual options in it,
or you guessed it, options.

103
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.777
So it will look like something like this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Select, option,

104
00:06:24.777 --> 00:06:29.578
and then you have Seattle,
Portland, San Francisco,

105
00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:32.823
etc.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

106
00:06:32.823 --> 00:06:36.833
we'll get more into that later, but they
have various values as well, and that will

107
00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:40.520
be the value that's actually sent back
to your server, if they select that.

108
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.120
So if I select Seattle, it's gonna
send back to this version of Seattle.

109
00:06:53.884 --> 00:06:57.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, the next one is a form.

110
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.122
A form is for if you have like a large
form that someone's filling out that's

111
00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:04.392
like first name, last name,
state, address etc., etc.,

112
00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:08.880
like there's a bunch of different inputs,
you wanna gather that all up in one place.

113
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.549
Use a form as kind of
like the container for

114
00:07:10.549 --> 00:07:15.150
all of that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's more to forms.

115
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.600
We're not necessarily gonna get into that
today because there's a lot of stuff you

116
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.745
can get into with forms, and it's not
particularly interesting in my opinion.

117
00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:29.391
[LAUGH] Yeah, forms are for grouping
together inputs, text areas, selects,

118
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:35.791
those kind of things.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Tables,

119
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:40.206
so tables gonna really
bad wrap in HTML because,

120
00:07:40.206 --> 00:07:47.651
back before we had useful amounts of CSS,
we use to layout websites using tables.

121
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:52.029
Imagine trying to like paint a picture
using Excel, and that's what writing

122
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:58.059
websites and using tables felt like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're way beyond that now,

123
00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:02.210
we haven't use table to layout things
like in the decade, I would say.

124
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.323
But people still have this aversion
to using tables because they're so

125
00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:10.177
traumatized by back then.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You should

126
00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:13.250
still use tables if you have
a table of data, right?

127
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.058
Like if you have something that you would
use Excel to display, then use a table,

128
00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:19.483
that's totally fine.

129
00:08:19.483 --> 00:08:22.075
If you're trying to layout a website,
do not use tables.

130
00:08:22.075 --> 00:08:27.360
[LAUGH] So,
a table is like the container for

131
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.090
the entire table, a tr is one row, and

132
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.973
a td is one cell.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So right here,

133
00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:36.860
I have a table.

134
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.940
In fact, we can just copy and
paste that and see what

135
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.545
it looks like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's

136
00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:51.745
go back up here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so I have (0,0),

137
00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:52.909
(1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).

138
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.394
Let's just put these on different rows so
you can kind of see what that looks like.

139
00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:09.159
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

140
00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the table contains for

141
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.410
the whole table, right?

142
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.750
One tr is one row right,

143
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.715
table row follows.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

144
00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:24.408
then we have it one td is one
individual cell here, right, so

145
00:09:24.408 --> 00:09:30.530
I have (0,0) which is there,
and then (1,0) it's here.

146
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.359
Then you have another tr, so
that's the next row down (0,1) and

147
00:09:35.359 --> 00:09:40.272
(1,1), right there, make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So something that

148
00:09:40.272 --> 00:09:45.163
you'll kinda find just with HTML and CSS
in general is we start at the top left and

149
00:09:45.163 --> 00:09:48.510
we work our way right and
then we go down, right?

150
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.610
So the first one we put in
here is the top left one.

151
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.030
That's also how a bunch
of stuff works in CSS, so

152
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.760
just usually the 0.00 is
gonna be the top left of

153
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.577
whatever you're working with.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

154
00:10:03.577 --> 00:10:07.905
if I were to put,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's say,

155
00:10:07.905 --> 00:10:10.913
another table around here,
it would go underneath it,

156
00:10:10.913 --> 00:10:15.344
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure enough, it does.

157
00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:23.648
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rather it's this one's 2,

158
00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:32.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 0 and 1 and 2.

159
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.035
Anyway,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

160
00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:43.629
then if I put another td right here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here,

161
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:47.768
right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, makes sense,

162
00:10:47.768 --> 00:10:53.998
cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

163
00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:59.110
that's tables, and yeah, so
there are many more tags.

164
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.013
I didn't even necessarily
cover all of the useful

165
00:11:02.013 --> 00:11:06.019
ones.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There are things like nav

166
00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:10.640
and header, and footer, things like that.

167
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.370
An article in a section and
a bunch of stuff like that.

168
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.580
So for example,
you have something that's like article.

169
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.580
It's something that you put
like an article inside of,

170
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.520
it's very descriptive
of what's inside of it.

171
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.688
It acts just like a div.

172
00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:28.049
The way it mechanically works,
it works exactly like a div would work.

173
00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:32.540
But what's nice about it,
is if someone's scraping your website,

174
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.570
like Google,
they'll instantly know this is an article,

175
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.960
this is something I can throw into
where I would display an article.

176
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.025
It's useful for
machines that are reading it.

177
00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:47.491
So if you use useful HTML machines that
are consuming will know a little bit

178
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:52.886
more about your website, you'll be
able to break you higher in Google.

179
00:11:52.886 --> 00:11:57.120
Or be able to scrape your website
in interesting and useful ways, and

180
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.632
also screen readers will be
able to read it more readily.

181
00:12:00.632 --> 00:12:04.470
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is a bunch more,

182
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.190
this will get you started but you will
be learning HTML tags probably for

183
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.370
all these little bit.

184
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.784
Any questions about anything
that we have talked about so

185
00:12:12.784 --> 00:12:14.800
far?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

186
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, when I did the button in

187
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.580
two different browsers,
it looks different.

188
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.262
A, is that something that you
ever have to be aware of?

189
00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:30.122
And B, is my hypothesis correct that
it's sort of like emoji between

190
00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:35.070
like Android and Apple kind of thing?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes to both of

191
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.630
your questions.

192
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.270
[LAUGH] So
it's something you should be aware of.

193
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:44.562
Usually that's okay, but when you use CSS,
you can make them look the same

194
00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:49.270
across operating systems and
browsers and all that kind of thing.

195
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:54.260
But yes, it will look different by
default, if you don't change anything.

196
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.937
You will almost always change something.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What's

197
00:12:57.937 --> 00:13:01.130
the other question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then,

198
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.240
is it just the difference in the browser
as the same as an emoji looks different

199
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.750
between Android and iPhone, for example?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes,

200
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.060
so it's the browser that's
making those different.

201
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.054
Cuz the browser is more or
less trying to have convergent

202
00:13:16.054 --> 00:13:20.313
looking things but
a lot of it is left up to them.

203
00:13:20.313 --> 00:13:24.850
Google and Chrome tends to make
things look more like Google, right.

204
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:29.210
So it's more like material like design,
it's more flat, all those kinds of things.

205
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.970
Whereas, Firefox has its
own way of thinking,

206
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.160
Edge has its own way of thinking.

207
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.642
So, it's those kind of details
are left up to the browser vendors.

208
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.313
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a good question.

209
00:13:39.477 --> 00:13:40.094
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact,

210
00:13:40.094 --> 00:13:45.507
that's actually one of the fun/horrifying
parts of being a frontend developer,

211
00:13:45.507 --> 00:13:48.980
is making things look
the same across browsers.

212
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.540
That's something that you constantly,
constantly battle with is,

213
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.760
this works in Firefox but
it doesn't work in Chrome.

214
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.320
How many times have we said that?

215
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.700
I've said that literally yesterday,
if we're being honest.

216
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.800
[LAUGH] I literally had to fix
something for that very reason.

217
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.300
So, it's one of the common problems
that we deal with is cross problem,

218
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:16.960
cross browser problems, and the worst
by far these days is Mobile Safari.

219
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.420
I spent so much time fixing things for
Mobile Safari,

220
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.000
it used to be Internet Explorer.

221
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.290
But luckily, not many people
use Internet Explorer anymore.

222
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.380
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good questions.

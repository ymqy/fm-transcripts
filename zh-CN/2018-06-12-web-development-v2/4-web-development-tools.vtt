00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.795
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If we're gonna build
a house, a craftsperson needs their tools,

2
00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:05.392
right?

3
00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:06.623
So I'm gonna go through here.

4
00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:10.937
I'm going to basically talk a little
about what I'm going to be using and

5
00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:15.630
make some recommendations to you of
good tools I think to start with.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.480
That being said,
if you have tools that you already like or

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
that you want to use,
I will try to as best as I can

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.260
with my knowledge accommodate all
the tools that I have knowledge of.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.510
That being said,

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.715
if you're gonna be use tools that
esoteric then you are on your own.

11
00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.040
[LAUGH]
So,

12
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.070
I am using Mac OS today,
if you can't tell.

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.800
I will do my best to try and
explain Windows as well.

14
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.020
That's quite funny,
cuz I work at Microsoft, and

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.230
I do not use [LAUGH] Windows.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.970
So, I will do my best,
specifically with Bash, and Windows

17
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.540
it gets really sketchy really quickly,
so we will work through it together.

18
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.050
I think is the answer to that question.

19
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.693
Anyway, we'll get there.

20
00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:09.331
If you're on Linux, I have a little
bit more knowledge there of, and

21
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:13.100
what's nice about using Linux is
it's pretty similar to Mac anyway.

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.873
So if you're using Linux you should
be able to follow along, more or

23
00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:19.980
less, with what I'm doing.

24
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.821
Also I expect,
if you're using Linux that you already

25
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:29.460
have some of that pre-existing
knowledge anyway.

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.393
So, asking a developer
about their tools is like,

27
00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:35.873
well it's a giant mistake,
because they will rant at you for

28
00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:40.266
hours about why they right, and
why everyone else is using terrible tools.

29
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:44.220
I don't know why we felt this
need to like validate ourselves.

30
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.879
It's like, I'm using this tool,
and you have to use a tool, or

31
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.614
you have to use this as well, or
you're an idiot, I don't know.

32
00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:51.011
Some dumb stuff like that, and

33
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.714
everyone's trying to use like
the latest shiniest stuff.

34
00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.263
Just find tools that work for you.

35
00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:59.744
Like if something works for you, and
speaks to you, then just go with that,

36
00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.612
and that's awesome, and
I really encourage you to go down that.

37
00:02:03.612 --> 00:02:04.980
You don't have to use what's new.

38
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.680
You don't have to use what's shiny.

39
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.553
Just use what works for
you, and be open-minded.

40
00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:14.067
Do try new tools and
see if they do work for you, and

41
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:19.780
if you find yourself fighting your tools,
then you should question your tools.

42
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.770
That's the other thing as well.

43
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.950
A little bit of investment in making
sure that you have the best tools will

44
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.080
go a long way.

45
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.900
So you should alway be kind of thinking
about like how can I improve this.

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.650
Okay, the first thing is we're
gonna be building websites.

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.324
You need to choose what
browser you're going to use.

48
00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:41.850
I am using Firefox.

49
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.338
I'm a huge Mozilla fan, just in general,
with of their mission and

50
00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:50.052
how they're going about making
the web a better place.

51
00:02:50.052 --> 00:02:51.640
So I will be using Firefox.

52
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.000
You are definitely welcome to use Chrome.

53
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.890
I think most people will probably
use Chrome, and that's okay too.

54
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.180
Both of them are world-class browsers
that have great developer tools,

55
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.400
as well as Safari, and Edge.

56
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.850
I don't know as much about Opera.

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.816
But definitely in this class,
I can speak really well to Edge,

58
00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:19.604
Safari, Chrome, and Firefox,
and I will be using Firefox.

59
00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:22.572
If you are using Safari,
if that's what you're electing to use,

60
00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:23.901
I have this link here for you.

61
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:26.310
Make sure you enable the developer tools.

62
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.500
That's quite important.

63
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.810
[LAUGH] Everything else I've
just enabled by default.

64
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.290
But yeah, Safari you have to actually go
check a box that's like I'm a developer,

65
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.550
please show me the developer tools.

66
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.020
Questions about that?

67
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.852
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Student: Do you use developer edition

68
00:03:44.852 --> 00:03:48.300
at all in Firefox or just the regular?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: At work

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.460
I actually use nightly,

70
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.300
which is like the even more bleeding
edge one than the developer edition.

71
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.040
Today I'm just gonna be
using the normal one.

72
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.440
I don't actually really know
the difference between all.

73
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.300
There's like four different
versions of Firefox.

74
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.562
It used to make a difference because
the nightly developer one was so

75
00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:13.492
far ahead, they had made so many changes
to it, but as of maybe six months ago,

76
00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:18.201
they kind of merged that all together,
and now just the stable one is really

77
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:23.630
great.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

78
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.149
Good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyone else?

79
00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:33.084
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

80
00:04:33.084 --> 00:04:34.650
The editor.

81
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.659
So this is the tool that you're
going to be using to write code

82
00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.258
actually.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There are many many

83
00:04:41.258 --> 00:04:44.678
options, and this is probably the most
contentious thing that you can ask some of

84
00:04:44.678 --> 00:04:47.593
them is that what editor do you use,
cuz everyone has an opinion, and

85
00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:48.745
they're all terrible.

86
00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:54.590
[LAUGH]
I personally use Visual Studio Code.

87
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.362
This is no surprise,
cuz I do work at Microsoft, and

88
00:04:57.362 --> 00:04:59.951
I work closely with
the Visual Studio Code team.

89
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.483
That being said, it is a fantastic editor.

90
00:05:02.483 --> 00:05:04.070
I'm a huge fan of it.

91
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.432
I was actually using this before
I even worked at LinkedIn.

92
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.900
I used this when I was working at Netflix.

93
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.050
So this is actually an opinion I held
before I started working at Microsoft.

94
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.479
The biggest thing that gave me
pause about Visual Studio Code,

95
00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.939
when I was thinking about trying it,
is I used to use Visual Studio

96
00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.423
when I was in college, and
it is a huge, just it's a big program.

97
00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:31.121
It's very heavy.

98
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.364
It takes a lot of resources, it's for
writing C++, and serious programing, and

99
00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:39.126
things like that, and so I didn't wanna
go back into that, but it turns out

100
00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:43.180
Visual Studio Code, the only thing that
it really shares with that is the name.

101
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.700
It's completely different,
it's written totally different,

102
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.890
it's a different code base,
it's written in TypeScript,

103
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.740
which is a flavor of JavaScript,
it's totally different from Visual Studio.

104
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.280
So I have a link on here,
if you wanna download it.

105
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.530
I highly recommend it.

106
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.692
I'm a big fun.

107
00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:04.558
It's very, I would say,
beginner friendly as well,

108
00:06:04.558 --> 00:06:08.171
which is another reason
that I recommend it to you,

109
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:12.720
and there's a huge amount of
plugins available for it as well.

110
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.811
So if you have something that
you want it to do, someone's

111
00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:20.037
probably written a plugin to help you do
that as well, which is really cool, and

112
00:06:20.037 --> 00:06:24.264
the plugins are written in JavaScript so
if you have an idea of something that you

113
00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:28.175
want your editor to do, you can write
the code yourself after this right,

114
00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:31.941
because you'll have the tool
JavaScript that you'll be able to use.

115
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.312
If you're not filling that,
feel free to use Sublime Text 3.

116
00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:40.264
That's what I used for like a decade, so
I'm also very very familiar with Sublime,

117
00:06:40.264 --> 00:06:41.401
it is a great tool.

118
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.780
It's very fast.

119
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.040
That's what I liked about it,
it opens files really quickly.

120
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.263
It's very efficient.

121
00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:52.050
And there is Atom which I haven't
spent any time with it, but

122
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.590
there are people that do love it.

123
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.120
It's written by GitHub.

124
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.069
Sublime Text is written by just
a guy that, now he has two or

125
00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.983
three employees working with him as well.

126
00:07:01.983 --> 00:07:04.710
Atom and Visual Studio Code are 100% free.

127
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.660
There's not even a premium tier,
it's just a free tool.

128
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.522
Sublime Text 3 is free to download and
it's forever in trial mode,

129
00:07:15.522 --> 00:07:18.470
it has a trial that never expires.

130
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.680
So I think once you buy,
I think it's $80 if I remember correctly,

131
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.120
and then it will just stop showing
an annoying pop-up that's all,

132
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.530
whenever you start up the tool.

133
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.304
It's worth paying.

134
00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:31.610
For me, I spend enough time looking
at my editor, I've have paid for

135
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.350
sublime several times over, and

136
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.100
I probably should pay them more because
they bought me a decade of productivity.

137
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.761
Just worth something I suppose.

138
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.476
If you want something
more Visual Studio-esque,

139
00:07:43.476 --> 00:07:46.883
like something a little bit more
like Eclipse, or NetBeans, or

140
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:50.010
something like that,
there's a tool called WebStorm.

141
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:56.527
I have not used it either, but it's a more
complete suite of tools I would say.

142
00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:59.130
I'm not gonna speak a lot more to it,
but it is not free.

143
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.060
You'd have to pay for it, but
the people that do use it,

144
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.690
swear by it, so
Feel free to check out web storm as well.

145
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.840
They make things, pie charm and
ruby mine and a bunch of other things,

146
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.800
what's tell it Jay,
bunch of things like that.

147
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.878
And they are smart people.

148
00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:20.576
Lastly, I'm gonna state
that this tools exist and

149
00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:26.360
that you should not use them [LAUGH]
Unless you've already used them.

150
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.520
There's a tool called Vim and
there's a tool called Emacs.

151
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.462
These are command line tools,
they're very difficult to use,

152
00:08:34.462 --> 00:08:38.487
they're for
someone far smarter than I am and also,

153
00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:43.336
you will know everyone that uses
them because they will tell you

154
00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:47.933
right away that they use these
things [LAUGH] I'm not upset.

155
00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.598
I'm so sick of hearing about them, so.

156
00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:53.890
Anyway, they exist.

157
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.700
I'm gonna tell you don't use them because
the people that are already using them

158
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.560
are gonna say, screw you,
I'm not gonna keep using them.

159
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.730
And everyone hopefully will listen and
not use them so.

160
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.010
Any questions about that?

161
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.882
I bet you there is someone
[INAUDIBLE] Freaking about this.

162
00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:08.551
Yep.

163
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:09.327
Knew it.

164
00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:13.920
[LAUGH] They're great tools.

165
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.800
They just have a super
steep learning curve, and

166
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.470
that's not what you wanna do today.

167
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.910
You already have a mountain ahead of you.
&gt;&gt; Student2: Actually,

168
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.040
most people are saying that Vim was
a nightmare and a rabbit hole to go down,

169
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.530
not the other end way around.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

170
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.040
&gt;&gt; Student2: You're going

171
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.662
on defending it.

172
00:09:29.662 --> 00:09:30.182
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; multiple: [LAUGH]

173
00:09:30.182 --> 00:09:31.608
&gt;&gt; Student2: First saying that there was

174
00:09:31.608 --> 00:09:33.755
a lot of wasted time.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm sure that

175
00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:36.160
people are gonna contradict me.

176
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.060
But the people that I've talked to
about it, it was a giant time suck and

177
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.370
I kinda regret doing it, but now that I've
done it, I'm gonna continue doing it.

178
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.260
Right?
That's more or

179
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.830
less the sentiment about it.

180
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:50.780
It's really interesting to watch
someone that's a wizard at Emacs,

181
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.220
Nina Zacharenko, one of the other Frontend
Masters teachers that I used to work with.

182
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.590
Actually, and now work with again.

183
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.150
She's a wizard with Emacs.

184
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.640
It's really crazy to watch the stuff
that she can do super quickly.

185
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.180
Or the Vin masters,
Ryan Florence, they just fly.

186
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.630
I don't wanna do that though,
I don't care.

187
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.980
I don't want to spend that much
time [LAUGHS] So, you should.

188
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.270
That's another thing,
tackle one mountain at a time.

189
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:23.831
Don't try and learn the editor at
the same time as you're learning to code.

190
00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:24.909
Any other questions?

191
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.103
Our resurgence said,
Vim is terrible, I'm listening.

192
00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:39.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, The Terminal.

193
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.734
So, there is two things that
I'm kinda separating out here,

194
00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:44.858
there is the shell and the emulator.

195
00:10:44.858 --> 00:10:47.470
And hopefully, I can kind of
explain the difference to you.

196
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.680
So, I'll just bring up my terminal here.

197
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.100
Terminal looks like this.

198
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.690
Right?
I'm sure most of you have seen this.

199
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.490
It's a little scary for new people offer
each approach in code, this is the matrix.

200
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.630
Right?

201
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.120
It's actually just a really
fancy File Explorer.

202
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.440
Or maybe it's a less fancy files floor.

203
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.860
Let's go with that.

204
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.240
This, right, you click on something.

205
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.820
And like you click on here.

206
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.990
It's the same thing with here.

207
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.050
I would just go to applications, right.

208
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.910
And I can see what's inside of
the application, which is nothing.

209
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.450
That was CD talks.

210
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.200
Right?

211
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.570
And you can see what's in there.

212
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.860
It's okay, I wanna go into webdev.

213
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.882
Right?

214
00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:29.840
And you can see what's in there.

215
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.210
We're gonna spend
an entire section on that.

216
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.520
But that's where the terminal is.

217
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.210
Right?

218
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.550
So the emulator is actually the window
that you're running this thing in.

219
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.290
So, that would be, in this case, I'm
running it in something called iTerm and

220
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.280
it really doesn't
actually matter too much.

221
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.340
There's one built-in to
Mac called Terminal.App.

222
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.250
Looks like this.

223
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.820
And you can see here,
it is the same thing, right.

224
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.520
So, that's what I'm trying to say here.

225
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.020
It doesn't really matter
what emulator that you use.

226
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.775
So, if you don't have anything installed,
just go ahead and use terminal dot app.

227
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.850
I'm told it's the fastest by far.

228
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:23.460
[LAUGH] The reason why I continually
using iTerm is, it does a thing where I

229
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.287
can actually have two shells next to each
other and that's just really useful to me.

230
00:12:28.287 --> 00:12:33.010
Anyway, so that is the emulator,

231
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.230
it does not matter, so
just pick one and go with it.

232
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.770
So, I'm using iTerm2 today.

233
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.300
And the default Terminal App is great,

234
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.810
there is another one called hyper which
is the hipster one to use at the moment,

235
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.930
it is written in JavaScript
which is pretty cool,

236
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.490
the last time I used it was really slow so
I just got sick of it went back to i term.

237
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.600
But, I'm told,
it's gotten better since then.

238
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.130
So, feel free to use Hyper.

239
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.320
If you are on Windows, I'm told that
Hyper also works really well for Windows.

240
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.130
And there's one called cmder,
I don't know anything about it,

241
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.629
so use it at your own risk.

242
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.520
If you're on Linux, I would just suggest
use whatever the one that Linux came with,

243
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.264
whatever your flavor of Linux came with.

244
00:13:25.264 --> 00:13:26.530
In other words, I have no idea.

245
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.112
[LAUGH] So, any one of these,

246
00:13:30.112 --> 00:13:34.300
totally fine, does not matter.

247
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.120
For the shells,

248
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.030
that's actually what the code that's
running inside the emulator, right.

249
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.430
So, you have iTerm, and then iTerm is
running something inside of it, right.

250
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:51.070
That's called the shell and
it does matter which shell you're using.

251
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.170
Use Bash, please, today.

252
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.790
If you're using something else,
you are on your own and

253
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.150
I do not know how to work ZSH or
any of the other ones.

254
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.530
Actually, I quite like Fish,
which is another one.

255
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.430
But we are not using it because
no one else uses Fish besides me.

256
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.300
So, if you are using Fish, okay, cool.

257
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.626
So, Fish is cool.

258
00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:18.080
Anyway, just use bash.

259
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.860
We're using bash today.

260
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.870
And the reason being is that,
every time that you google something,

261
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.380
the answer is always written in bash,
a hundred percent of the time.

262
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.440
No one writes in anything
else besides bash.

263
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.290
So, that's a really good
reason to use bash.

264
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.020
It's ubiquitous.

265
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.620
It's everywhere.

266
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.028
Okay, so, that's your terminal tool,
we will get much more into that probably

267
00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:48.433
more towards the end of tomorrow.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Lastly, just

268
00:14:48.433 --> 00:14:52.294
you should be really careful where you get
your news from, you should also be really

269
00:14:52.294 --> 00:14:56.830
careful what developer resources you are
looking at when you are Googling things.

270
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.550
And, so, I wanted to give you
a few that I trust personally,

271
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.750
that whenever I'm Googling something these
are the first resources that I see if they

272
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.660
have anything on it.

273
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.300
So, my favorite developer resource
of all time that I love and

274
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.440
I literally have it open all the time,
I'm not exaggerating,

275
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.320
is literally always open
on my laptop is the MDN.

276
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.880
It used to stand for
Mozilla Developer Network and

277
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.710
now it's actually,
they've just said now it's called MDN.

278
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.020
It doesn't stand for anything anymore.

279
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.080
It's just called MDN.

280
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.030
It's from Mozilla.

281
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.880
It's @developer.mozilla.org.

282
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.080
And it is, it's just the bible.

283
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.860
Right?

284
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.250
It's everything about Web
programming in one spot.

285
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:45.860
So, if I have a question about,
let's say h1s, you just

286
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.200
click here and it just has it's complete.

287
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.990
So, it's gonna have everything on here,
but

288
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.610
it's also approachable
which is kind of rare.

289
00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.430
Either something is complete and
complicated usually, or

290
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.670
it's not complete and simple.

291
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.660
They kind of strike a good balance here,
so MDN is just the best.

292
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.709
Anything that you can always
trust is something that it's on

293
00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:16.244
the MDN.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah,

294
00:16:16.244 --> 00:16:18.340
great, great resource.

295
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.083
There's another one out there called
W3 Schools that usually comes up before

296
00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:24.804
the MDN, and I would suggest
that you skip W3 Schools and

297
00:16:24.804 --> 00:16:29.332
go to the MDN
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I am a huge fan of

298
00:16:29.332 --> 00:16:30.480
CSS Tricks.

299
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.910
This is specifically very helpful for
CSS and

300
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.880
HTML, but they also have really
good JavaScript resources as well.

301
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:45.220
They also have amazing articles,
just in general as a publication, but

302
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.640
they have here like with Flexbox
cuz that's usually what it is.

303
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.740
So, for example, we're gonna be
learning about Flex later today, and

304
00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.350
they have this amazing resource
of how to do Flex really well.

305
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.782
It has diagrams and it's really,
really well-written,

306
00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:07.440
so for learning about CSS and HTML,

307
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.311
I definitely suggest CSS Tricks.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For

308
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:16.660
video content, there's a website
called Frontend Masters, okay?

309
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.330
I give it like a four out of ten.

310
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.290
I'm just kidding,
it's great, I like it a lot.

311
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.410
I recommend a ton of resources in here,
not because they pay me to or

312
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.073
anything like that.

313
00:17:27.073 --> 00:17:30.570
I mean, they could, you could, [LAUGH] but

314
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:35.130
because I legitimately
think it's awesome content.

315
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.300
Like I have watched a bunch
of stuff on there myself.

316
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.790
They're kind of teachers that
they get are really great.

317
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.340
So, if it's on in front of the Master's,

318
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.580
you can pretty well guarantee
it's going to be good stuff.

319
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.560
It's worth watching.

320
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.840
Lastly, if I'm working with a library or a
framework or some, like, specific piece of

321
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.780
technology, it's usually a good idea to go
directly to the documentation to read it.

322
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.660
If I'm working with, like, React, I'll
usually go to the React documentation.

323
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.180
It's good to refer those because
the developers will tend to keep

324
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.920
those things up to date whereas like a
StackOverflow answer might be out of date.

325
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.970
So, that's a good thing
to keep in mind as well.

326
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.170
Another thing also I don't have on here,

327
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.300
but StackOverflow actually uses
a pretty good resources as well.

328
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:22.110
Cuz usually like even as things progress,
people will re-answer questions and

329
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.760
upload them and so Stack overflow's also
a good place to get questions answered.

330
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.430
Frontend Masters does this really cool
thing called the Frontend Handbook.

331
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:40.760
It's written by this guy named
Cody Lindley, who's a really smart guy.

332
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.940
And it's just kinda like a huge
overview of the entire topography of

333
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.260
the frontend development world.

334
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.770
And it's just great.

335
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.000
It's super exhaustive.

336
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.210
They go over a bunch of stuff,
yeah, it's great.

337
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.883
So it's also good to just kind
of peruse and go through, and

338
00:18:59.883 --> 00:19:05.277
see what's in there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

339
00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:11.830
it's free, which awesome as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

340
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.807
Any questions about any of
the tools that I've proposed?

341
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:22.819
&gt;&gt; Student: Do you cover from Microsoft or

342
00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:26.260
for Windows about what
to use the terminal.

343
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I did Yeah,we talked about

344
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.790
hyper or CMDR.

345
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.770
DER, rather.

346
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.850
It looks like that.

347
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.930
I mean it looks nice.

348
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.490
That's usually how I judge my tools.
&gt;&gt; Student2: VS code also has terminals

349
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.590
built into it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good point.

350
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.790
In fact, it's a great point.

351
00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.040
If you go into VS code.

352
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:55.120
Do I have VS code up in here?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is VS code.

353
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.640
This is what it looks like.

354
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.260
And I think it's Ctrl+tilde.

355
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.440
Yeah, it brings up this terminal
down here in the bottom.

356
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.510
And you can actually use the terminal
built into VS code as well.

357
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:11.920
So Good point.
&gt;&gt; Student3: Yeah, I was asking if we

358
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.730
needed to download Bash.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is a great question,

359
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.510
do we need to download Bash?

360
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.670
The answer to that question is no, because

361
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.660
every operating system should already
have Bash installed, including Mac,

362
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.630
Linux and
even Windows 10 now actually does have it.

363
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.900
If you are using Windows 10,
there are these steps right

364
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.961
here that if you click on it, they'll
take you to a link on the Microsoft.

365
00:20:43.961 --> 00:20:47.590
We'll take you to how to enable it for
Windows 10

366
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.770
If you're on anything before Windows 10,
you are unfortunately out of luck.

367
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.690
[LAUGH] So the only thing here that you
should have to actually download is

368
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.470
whatever editor you're using.

369
00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.310
I imagine most of you probably already
have a browser that you're comfortable

370
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.240
with, but if not then download
the browser that you want as well.

371
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.290
Otherwise, everything should
already be on your computer.

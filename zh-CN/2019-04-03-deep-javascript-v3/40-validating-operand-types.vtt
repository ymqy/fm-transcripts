&gt；&gt；Kyle Simpson：有一件事我认为在打字稿中被低估了，这是
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: One thing that I think is undervalued within TypeScript this is

2
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.879
实际上我更多的虫子是从哪里来的。
actually where many more of my bugs have come from.

3
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.970
除了能够静态输入信息之外
It's that in addition to being able to a static typing information about

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.910
变量赋值，它还可以告诉我们某些操作将是无效的。
variable assignments, it can also tell us that certain operations would be invalid.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.300
在这个特殊的例子中，它说你不能从一个数字中减去一个字符串。
In this particular case, it's saying you can't subtract a string from a number.

6
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.719
因为那个特殊的偏好是说不允许强迫，并且
Because that particular preference is saying don't allow that coercion, and

7
00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.789
在这个特殊的情况下，这对我来说是一个非常有用的帮助。
in this particular case, that would be a really useful help for me.

8
00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.030
我真的很想
I would really like for

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.700
一个Linter告诉我，不要试图从一个数字中减去一个字符串。
a linter to tell me, don't try to subtract a string from a number.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.250
我真正想要的是一件让我拥有它的短裤，但是
What I'd really like is a linter that let me have that, but

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.469
不让我对我所有的静态类型作业有所有的抱怨。
not let me have all the complaints about all my static type assignments.

12
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.859
那是我的偏好。
That would be my preference.

13
00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.039
但我认为，这是他们所做的事情中被低估的一部分。
But this is, I think, an undervalued part of what they do.

14
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.979
他们实际上允许我们检查操作
Is that they are actually allowing us to check the operations that

15
00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.384
我们正在做我们大部分业务逻辑所在的地方，并且
we're doing where most of our business logic is, and

16
00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:55.478
确保这些操作有效。
making sure that those operations are valid.

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
如果TypeScript有一些机制，您可以允许这样做，那就太好了
It would be nice if TypeScript would have some mechanism by which you could allow

18
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.179
更多的胁迫会发生。
some more coercion to occur.

19
00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.584
因为有很多地方，正如我已经提出的那样，
Because there are plenty of places, as I've already made the case,

20
00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:10.474
在那里，我希望能够进行强制和其他地方，我希望避免它。
where I'd like to be able to do coercion and other Places I'd like to avoid it.

21
00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:14.085
在我看来，在我的研究中，打字稿是一种要么全部要么什么都没有。
It appears to me in my research that Typescript is kind of all or nothing.

22
00:01:14.085 --> 00:01:17.765
你要么选择加入，要么不选择。
You opt into it or you don't opt into it.

23
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.396
我更喜欢有更多的细微差别和配置。
I'd prefer there to be more nuance and configuration.
